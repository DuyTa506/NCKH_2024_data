The couple did not have children and took each other around the world
Two Bangladeshi tourists decided not to have children and spent time visiting 102 countries and territories over 16 years.
Shahariath Sarmin, 45 years old, and Rezaul Bahar, 47 years old, got married in 2005 and moved to Connecticut, USA. The couple started traveling three years later, to the Bahamas.
The couple said they do not regret not having children but spending time and money traveling. In 16 years they have visited 7 continents, 102 countries and plan to visit 195 countries.
The couple said "they don't want to have children to have more joy in life" and decided not having children was "the right thing" after traveling to many countries. "Travel is a kind of happiness for us," the husband said about their mutual passion for travel.
Bahar is an engineer, Sarmin is a business consultant. They use most of their annual leave to travel. Every year the couple makes at least 6-8 trips, spending a total of half a million USD on trips over 16 years.
We invest in tourism, the husband shared.
When asked about their reasons for traveling so much, Bahar said it helps them "keep moving forward." For the wife, traveling is a time to rest, escape the daily pressure of work and housework. "The most important thing is that I travel with Bahar," Sarmin said.
Some of their favorite places to visit together are Antarctica, Alaska, Mongolia, Egypt, Iceland, Kenya, Morrocco, Patagonia, Jordan, Chile and the Faroe Islands. The wife likes Alaka state, USA, most for its "quiet" and Kenya for its wild life. Sarmin once had the opportunity to see wild animals up close in the Maasai Mara national reserve.
Bahar likes Antarctica best. "People must understand the vastness. Everything is majestic," the male tourist said about Antarctica. They were also overwhelmed when they arrived in Egypt, which gives visitors the feeling of "going back in time".
The place the couple doesn't like to go is big cities except Dubai, where everything is "shiny", including people, culture and architectural works. This year, they planned to go on a spontaneous trip in March and planned to go to Bulgaria in May.
While many people feel tired and jetlag when traveling, they say they "rarely think about sleeping when they go abroad". Frequent traveling has become their way of life.
Bahar said those who don't travel are "missing the opportunity to see what they can see" and encouraged everyone who is physically and mentally able to travel.

Go through four layers of security to welcome dawn at Tiananmen
China
Having to register in advance, getting up at 2:45 a.m., going through four layers of security to enter the square to watch the sunrise at Tiananmen is one of the valuable experiences.
Trinh Thu Hang (over 40 years old, Hanoi) has traveled to dozens of provinces and cities in the country and countries around the world. She shares her experience when she came to China in 2023.
In our more than 10-day itinerary, we initially did not include Tiananmen Square, because we had seen so much on TV that there seemed to be nothing worth exploring. But after visiting the Forbidden City and walking to the National Museum next door, we were curious to see a long queue to visit the square.
There are fences around Tiananmen, and many security personnel are equipped with a series of modern equipment. We approached and introduced ourselves as foreign tourists who wanted to visit. They politely explained that any visitors wishing to enter must register at least one day in advance via Wechat, no exceptions. I've been to hundreds of squares around the world, from Red Square in Moscow (Russia) or Concorde Square in Paris (France), but this is the first time I've heard that entering the square requires registration or "line up online." ".
There are a series of large signs with QR codes, guiding visitors step by step to register for admission to the square, all in Chinese. We also took out our phones, which had Wechat pre-installed, and signed up for the next day, but all the time slots were gone. This is the largest square in the world, able to welcome hundreds of thousands of people at the same time, with an area of ​​44 hectares, more than 60 times the size of My Dinh Stadium in Hanoi. Because the next day was full, we had to register for the next day with the earliest time slot, because we heard people say that the flag-raising ceremony at Tiananmen was very worth watching.
On the registered day, we woke up at 2:45 a.m., cooked breakfast in a rented apartment in central Beijing, and then set off. Traveling at this time is a problem, because every day we take public transportation, and at midnight there are no buses or trains operating. The night before, we asked the motel owner to book a taxi to Tiananmen. He tried many times but no driver picked up the car at that time. He told me to go to the apartment gate at 3:30 a.m., hoping that there would be a driver to take our ride, otherwise we could catch a taxi on the street.
With fragile hope, we waited at the gate of the apartment complex from 3:25 a.m. to 3:35 a.m. but didn't see any taxis. Beijing was sleeping, there was only one security guard sitting nearby. I approached, used all the translation tools to explain the situation and asked him to help me book a taxi via the app. He accepted, even though he didn't know who we were and didn't know a word of English. During the next 40 minutes, he patiently placed the order and then no one received it. He placed another order, and finally a driver accepted the ride and came to pick us up at 4:15 a.m., for 31 yuan (about 100,000 VND). . He also told the driver about our destination. We later understood that Tiananmen was very large. If the car stopped at the wrong place, we would have to walk a long way and easily get lost.
The driver took us to Tiananmen at 4:30. The daily flag-raising ceremony takes place before dawn. As soon as we set foot on the edge of the square, we were surprised to see groups of people running quickly toward the square, everyone afraid of being late. But getting into the square is not easy: first there is a layer of security with many officers in uniform. They check each person's ID, and if they are foreign guests, they check their passport. In the second security layer, they will scan IDs and passports through a reading device to see if there is a prior appointment and if this is the right time frame. The third layer of security is full body screening. If you don't bring anything suspicious, you can enter.
The final layer of security is checking all visitors' belongings. The two of us each had a light backpack but were still asked to take everything out. The security staff checked every corner of the backpack, flipped through each A4 page, then picked up the boiled egg we had prepared for breakfast and examined it carefully, shaking it to see if there were any strange noises. He confirmed everything was fine, smiled and thanked us, and invited us into the square.
Tiananmen at this time was a sea of ​​estimated tens of thousands of people, even though this was just the morning of a normal day. Elderly people, young people, young children, women, men, and many people with disabilities, all ages are present here, all holding their phones up towards the flagpole. Most of the babies were announced by their parents, everyone had an excited look on their faces. There was no noise or chaos, they happily stood together, a huge but very peaceful crowd. Because of my modest height, I could not fully observe the flag-raising ceremony, but I could clearly feel the excitement mixed with solemnity and emotion of the people standing around. An atmosphere never seen anywhere. We didn't see any foreigners, perhaps because few tourists were patient enough to register on the Chinese app, then get up at midnight to go to Tiananmen.
The flag was raised at nearly 5 o'clock, when the sun was already rising. After a moment of shouting, everyone began to gradually disperse, but there were still many people staying to play and rest on the square. We also saw dozens of families bringing breakfast, spreading towels and sitting down to enjoy breakfast right on the spot. Many groups of young people took commemorative photos. There are babies comfortably sleeping on the square, while parents leisurely sit and admire the scenery and chat. Many adults also lay down next to the flower bed to catch up on sleep, because anyone who wanted to be here at this time had to get up at midnight. The view of Tiananmen under sunrise is very beautiful. In addition to world-famous works, this place also has countless colorful flower beds that are meticulously and vividly cared for.
Another strange thing was that there was such a huge crowd, everyone was carrying bags under their arms, but we walked all over the square without seeing a single piece of trash. Everywhere is clean, the only "garbage" on the square is a few leaves from the rows of trees planted densely around. I observed for a while and saw that all the tourists here put trash in their bags and backpacks.
After walking around Tiananmen for more than an hour, we looked for a restroom. There is a row of free toilets a hundred meters long, with a large prominent symbol so it can be seen from anywhere on the square. The women's restroom has 3 rows, each row has 20 cubicles, serving 60 people at the same time. Many handwashing sinks are located outside, with hand sanitizer and hand dryers, so almost no one has to queue.
Leaving Tiananmen, we felt comfortable and excited because we had a unique experience that we had never seen anywhere else.

The ancient capital of Luang Prabang is at risk of losing its UNESCO title
Laos
Massive construction, overtourism, and loss of traditional culture are the main reasons why Luang Prabang is at risk of being removed from the UNESCO World Heritage list.
The ancient capital of Luang Prabang, located between the Mekong and Nam Khan rivers, is described as a picturesque destination with houses of harmonious Lao-French architecture. Luang Prabang was recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1995.
This location is also a major Buddhist cultural center in Laos. Visitors coming here can easily see monks in bright orange robes walking across the street, and long-tail wooden boats running along the river surrounded by hills of tropical trees.
Beneath the ancient exterior are the worries of locals and conservationists. UNESCO's new report points out a number of worrying issues; if not resolved soon, Luang Prabang may lose its World Heritage status. Problems include construction development causing the loss of traditional houses and structures in the protected old town. The ancient capital is facing overtourism and cultural life is gradually disappearing.
In particular, UNESCO's report emphasizes the construction of the Luang Prabang hydroelectric dam 25 km upstream by a Lao - Thai joint venture and the second dam to be built in the upcoming area will impact the value of the ancient capital. Laos. Minja Yang, former deputy director of the UNESCO World Heritage Center, fears this could turn the riverside town into a lakeside town.
If the second dam is built, it will be the main reason why Luang Prabang is removed from the world heritage list, Mr. Yang said.
A local government employee said he was concerned the town would lose its World Heritage listing. "UNESCO gave us many rules to follow, but now we do the opposite," the person told Nikkei Asia.
The ancient capital was named after Phra Bang, the golden Buddha statue given to King Fa Ngum in the 14th century. Luang Prabang is one of the oldest towns in Laos, with a history dating back thousands of years. This place was once the royal capital and the Buddhist center of Laos for most of its history.
After Laos gained independence from the French in 1953, the capital was moved to Vientiane. Luang Prabang fell into oblivion, thanks to which the old architectural features remained intact.
Currently, the ancient town has more than 600 buildings and 183 wetlands protected under the terms of the UNESCO agreement. People's living standards are increasing, the town is gradually rejuvenating as young people working in the tourism industry flock here. Tourist arrivals to the town have increased tenfold over the past two decades, with nearly 800,000 foreign visitors in the first three quarters of 2023.
Real estate prices have increased, many local people have chosen to sell or rent their houses and move out of the city. The indigenous population decreased, monasteries had to shrink in size. Traditional local offerings today mainly serve tourists. In a recent ceremony, a large number of foreigners participated in the offering ceremony. Some local shops are in a situation of ripping off tourists.
There are also major concerns about the potential impact of the Luang Prabang dam, reminiscent of the damage following a dam collapse in southern Laos in 2018, as well as the effects on the banks of the Mekong River.
Tourism in this town is on the rise, becoming an attraction for many Chinese investors. Local people said that from small shops to large hotels in Luang Prabanh, Chinese investors poured money into construction. The Laos-China railway also went into operation last year, connecting Kunming with Vientiane in just a few hours of travel. This also contributes to promoting the tourism market in Luang Prabang. Some locals fear that excessive tourism development will cause Luang Prabang to spring up with large buildings like those in Vientiane, and they don't want the town to lose its ancient beauty.
The UNESCO World Heritage Committee will have a decision on Luang Prabang's case in July. Experts predict it is likely that the town could be placed in "endangered" status.
The former Deputy Director of the UNESCO World Heritage Center said that without the World Heritage title, erroneous projects on shopping centers and casinos will quickly spring up in Luang Prabang.
All efforts to prevent these activities over the past 20 years may fail, and the future of the town is unknown, Mr. Minja Yang said.

5 tips to spend less in Singapore - the most expensive place in the world
Eating at hawkers, sleeping at love hotels, drinking kopi and hanging out at suburban beach bars are tips to help you spend less when traveling to Singapore.
The British weekly Economist published its annual ranking of the world's most expensive places to live in 2023 at the end of November last year. Singapore and Zurich are both at number one. Marielle Desscalsota, who has lived in Singapore for 20 years, said there is still a way for tourists to explore this most expensive destination in the world at an affordable price. Below are suggestions.
Eat and drink at hawker areas
Hawker or hawker centers are a destination visited by many tourists and residents because of their cheap prices, delicious food, and hygiene. Most main dishes cost no more than 5 SGD such as chicken rice if visitors visit Hawker Maxwell in Chinatown. If you visit Changi Village Hawker Center in the east of the country, the price is only about 3 SGD.
Drink kopi instead of trendy coffee
Instead of visiting luxury cafes to order an expensive latte or capuccino that can cost up to 6 SGD, visitors can try kopi - Singaporean coffee that is hand-roasted with 15 different processing methods. Locals often drink kopi to start the day for 1.2 SGD.
If you stay away from central areas and tourist attractions, you can also find a breakfast set including kopi, two slices of toast spread with coconut jam and soft-boiled eggs for 3 SGD.
Skip the bars and liquor stores on the crowded tourist beach
Many tourists often flock to Sentosa, an offshore island famous for its high-class resorts, clubs, and bars. Food and drink prices are often very high. A bottle of beer here costs 16 SGD, 4 times higher than at a convenience store.
Instead, visitors can party at Changi Beach beach club east of Signapore. Stella Lounge, a beach club in the area, sells draft beer for around 13 SGD. Also here, visitors can find many dining options priced under 10 SGD at many popular restaurants.
Overnight at love hotels
Instead of spending money at luxury hotels, Marielle Desscalsota suggests that tourists can book rooms at love hotels, where couples often rent by the hour. She rated this place as "the best value for money in Singapore".
Rooms at Hotel 81 Chinatown, one of the famous hotel chains, cost 95 SGD. Marielle rates this place as "clean, spacious, centrally located" and has a private bathroom instead of a shared one like in budget motels.

Airfare prices during Tet for domestic tours across Thailand and Singapore
Domestic tours using planes during the Lunar New Year are as high as tours to some countries in the region, posing a competition problem for domestic tourism.
Many travel agencies believe that northern inter-line tours are attractive to southern tourists during Lunar New Year. However, as noted by VnExpress, some mid-range foreign tours have competitive costs, even equal to domestic tours.
For guests from Ho Chi Minh City, options include Thailand 5 days 4 nights for 11 million VND, Ho Chi Minh City - Singapore - Malaysia 5 days 4 nights for about 14 million VND or Ho Chi Minh City - Singapore 3 days 2 nights for about 14 million VND. 13 million VND.
Meanwhile, air tickets from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi on February 12 (the 3rd day of Tet), returning on December 16 or December 17, cost about 5 million VND per person, with bad flight times. According to many travel agencies, tourists from south to north tend to choose inter-line tours, departing from Hanoi such as Bat Trang - Ninh Binh - Ha Long - Yen Tu for 4 days and 3 nights, during Tet the price is about 4,000 VND. 7 million VND. Adding up the costs, the amount spent on this journey is about 9.7 million VND per person.
Some northern itineraries flying from Ho Chi Minh City cost more than 10 million VND, such as Sa Pa - Lai Chau - Dien Bien - Son La - Moc Chau 5 days 5 nights, priced at 13 million VND; Cao Bang - Ba Be - Ha Giang tour 5 days 5 nights costs nearly 12.7 million VND.
For passengers departing from Hanoi, Mr. Bui Thanh Tu, Marketing Director of Best Price, said that when calculating the journey to Phu Quoc from February 12 to February 15, the total cost per passenger must be about 9,000 VND. 3 million VND, including 7 million VND for round-trip airfare; 2.3 million VND for three nights in a 3-star hotel room, including entertainment costs that can reach more than 11 million VND.
Thus, this itinerary costs nearly the same as the 5-day, 4-night tour to Thailand from Hanoi during Tet - about 11.9 million VND per person, including all food and entertainment costs.
Some other foreign itineraries worth considering during Tet are China road tours such as Hekou - Maitreya - Binh Bien - Kien Thuy - Khai Vien - Mong Tu for 4 days and 3 nights costing about 6.8 million VND; Hekou - Kunming - Kieu Tu Snow Mountain - Dien Tri Lake - Yunnan Cultural Village - Guandu Ancient City 4 days 3 nights cost about 5.7 million VND; tour to Phuong Hoang Ancient Town for about 9.5 million VND.
If you spend more money, tourists traveling from Hanoi can consider a 5-day, 4-night Singapore itinerary for 15.5-16.5 million VND per person.
Airplane tickets account for 40-60% of the total tour value, so when ticket prices increase, tour prices also increase. Package tour products are usually about 20% cheaper than booking individual services, Mr. Tu said.
According to Mr. Tu, domestic tours face competition from foreign tours in the low-cost segment. Mid-range products like Singapore and Taiwan have slightly higher prices, depending on departure point.
Ms. Tran Phuong Linh, Director of Marketing and Information Technology of BenThanh Tourist, said domestic airfares are often higher than international travel during peak occasions such as Lunar New Year and holidays. The reason is that international flights often have passengers from both ends, while domestic flights are usually only crowded on one end, causing the occupancy rate to be low, forcing airlines to push ticket prices high. This is just one of many reasons that affect the increase or decrease in air ticket prices such as gasoline prices, taxes or pricing policies of each airline.
Mr. Pham Anh Vu, Marketing Director of Viet Tourism Media Joint Stock Company, said it can be clearly seen that the price of tours using planes to go abroad is more competitive with domestic tours thanks to reasonable airfare prices. In addition, supporting policies of the tourism industry in neighboring destinations such as Thailand and Taiwan such as combined shopping to reduce overall prices; stimulate cash giving to tourists; Extending the length of stay also makes Vietnamese tourists gradually prefer to travel on some Asian routes instead of domestically.
Over the past year, Mr. Vu noticed that comparisons between domestic tourism and Thai tourism appeared a lot, accompanied by comments about price, service quality or destination attraction. If this situation continues, domestic tourism will significantly reduce competition with international tourism.
However, Mr. Vu said he cannot "put all the responsibility" for the increase in air ticket prices. A representative of this company suggested that it is necessary to promote the development of infrastructure such as roads, airports, and hotels to facilitate tourists and reduce transportation costs. In addition, Vietnam also needs to soon find a "conductor" to coordinate links between aviation, travel and localities. The business itself is also linking up with partners to bring the best prices, but still needs more support policies and widespread demand stimulation from higher levels.
Ms. Linh also agreed that there are many factors affecting the domestic tourism industry. "If it is not possible to adjust airfare prices, I think we should upgrade the service so that customers are satisfied with the money they spend," Ms. Linh said.
Meanwhile, a Best Price representative said that despite facing competition, domestic tours departing from Ho Chi Minh City still sell well, especially with middle-aged or overseas Vietnamese customers. Mr. Tu said this group has income, does not calculate much about costs and likes to explore in the country.
Mr. Minh Anh, a loyal customer of the company, lives in Thu Duc. Every year he takes his family of four to travel to the North because he likes to experience the spring air and mountain scenery. He said there is no need to travel abroad and cost has never been a consideration.

The sacred temple worships the one-legged god on top of the mountain
Thanh Hoa
Built during the Tran Dynasty (13th-14th centuries), Doc Cuoc Temple located at Sam Son estuary is known as the most sacred temple in the Thanh sea area.
Doc Cuoc Temple is located on top of Co Giai mountain (also known as sea turtle's neck), in Truong Le range, Sam Son city. Although not grand or magnificent, the ancient, mossy, mysterious appearance of the temple often attracts a large number of local people and tourists to visit and offer incense, especially on holidays.
According to local historical documents, Doc Cuoc Temple was built during the Tran Dynasty to commemorate the merits of the one-legged god who defeated the enemy and kept peace in the coastal village. The temple is associated with the legend of the giant boy who cut his body in half to both chase away demons at sea and fight enemies inland to protect the villagers.
The most special feature in the temple is the statue carved from solid wood, painted black, placed in a solemn position in the middle of the hall. The statue is about 30-40 cm tall, shaped like a vertical bust. The god wears a military uniform, holds a weapon, and his charisma exudes courage and majesty.
The Anthology of Thanh Hoa Legends records that the land of Sam Son was once peaceful, and the people of the coastal village diligently went out to sea every day to catch fish and shrimp to make a living. One day, suddenly out of nowhere on the sea appeared a group of monsters with strange and ferocious shapes. They came ashore to loot and brutally kill villagers.
The ferocious sea devils not only devour the fishermen they encounter, but when they are thirsty for prey, they also sneak onto the mainland and raid, making the lives of residents in the area always in a state of fear. Many families had to leave their homeland and lead each other to travel to other places in search of food.
At that time, the boy Doc Cuoc grew up as fast as he could. In just a short time, he grew into a tall man with extraordinary health who could rush to chase away fierce demons. To free the fishermen from a miserable life, the giant forged a large bronze hammer, preparing to fight the sea demons.
He showed a way for the fishermen's rafts to gather together and form a block, and the fishermen leaned back against each other, holding sharp poles pointing forward, forming a protective layer and ready to stab the fishermen. sea ​​monster. Facing the crowded and ferocious demons, the giant swung his hammer and bravely rushed into battle. The battle was fierce until the demons dispersed and disappeared, leaving only the giant stained with red blood standing next to the fishermen, unscathed.
Since then, every day the giant goes out to sea to fish with the fishermen. One day, the giant returned with the fishermen, saw the village in ruins, and knew that the demons were coming to cause trouble again. Faced with that situation, the giant decided to split his body in half, one half stood guard on Co Giai island, the other half followed the raft with the fishermen out to sea... From then on, the sea village returned to peace.
Legend has it that half of the giant's body stood on the top of the mountain, his feet deeply imprinted in the rock, remaining for thousands of years. Believing that it was a god from heaven sent to earth to help relieve disasters for people, the people of the coastal village of Sam Son built a temple right at the place where the god's footprints were left. The temple is named Doc Cuoc, and worships him as the god protecting the villagers.
Every year, on the occasion of February 16 of the lunar calendar, the people of the coastal village of Thanh hold a blessing festival, hoping for peace in the country, a good harvest for the people, and a prosperous and fulfilling life. In addition to this holiday, at Doc Cuoc temple, the banh chung and banh giay festival also takes place on the 12th day of the 5th lunar month every year. The festival attracts a large number of people and tourists to attend.
Although Doc Cuoc Temple is not imposing, it has a very unique architecture. To reach the main temple on the top of the mountain, from Ho Xuan Huong Street, visitors must cross a steep road with about 40 stone steps. The main temple area is built in a nail style, including a front hall, middle hall and back palace.
On the right hand side of the main temple is Nghinh Phong tower (also known as Phuong Dinh building), which is said to have been built hundreds of years ago. Nghinh Phong Tower has a two-storey structure with 8 roofs, bearing the bold architecture of the Nguyen Dynasty, seen from a distance like a lotus flower gradually opening its wings on the vast blue sea. On the left is the Mother Palace, where the Three Holy Mother Temples are worshiped, restored in 1992.
Not only does it look ancient and mysterious, Doc Cuoc Temple still preserves 8 ordinations bestowed by the feudal court of different periods. The ordinations are carefully preserved and monitored and are only opened when important events occur.
Among the eight ordinations, the ordination in the 44th year of Canh Hung (1783, during the reign of King Le Hien Tong) is the most prominent. The content of the ancient ordination reads: "Doc Cuoc is the most sacred saint among the saints with no equal. He used that talent and sacredness to preserve the borders of the country, protect the villagers and All things. For evil people, punish them harshly. What a merciful saint."
In 1962, Doc Couc Temple was ranked as a national historical and cultural relic by the Ministry of Culture (now the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism), along with neighboring relics in Sam Son such as Trong Mai island, Trong Mai temple, and Hoang Mai temple. To Hien Thanh and Co Tien temple.

The tree was 'captured' for more than a century
Pakistan
The chain in Peshawar has been "captured" since 1899 until now, when a British officer decided to teach it a lesson for "avoiding" him.
125 years ago, British officer James Squid, while drunk, made one of the strangest arrests in history in Landi Kotal, a town near the Torkhan border. Assuming the tree was moving away when he tried to approach, Squid ordered it chained to the ground and placed under arrest. The chains have remained in place ever since.
On the tree was placed a sign telling tourists about the arrest: "I am under arrest. One evening, a drunk British officer thought I was moving away from the original location and ordered the Mess officer arrested me. Since then I have been arrested."
Located in the Khyber Rifles Officers Mess area at Landi Kotal Way, the Chained Tree receives a lot of attention from tourists because of its humorous story. However, local people consider the tree a symbol of British rule's oppression of them.
Through this action, the British wanted to warn the people that if the tribes dared to act against them, they would also be punished in the same way, a local person said.
Despite its controversial past, the chained tree is a popular tourist attraction to the area.

Travel trends of Vietnamese tourists in 2024
In 2024, Vietnamese tourists tend to use social networks to find travel information, prioritize experience over cost, and prefer spontaneous travel over booking package tours.
Klook platform's January 2024 report announced the results of the Travel Pulse survey on travel trends in the Asia Pacific region in 2024. The survey was conducted in November 2023 with 2,600 respondents. , in 13 markets including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Korea, Japan, Australia, Mainland China, India and Indonesia.
The survey shows that social networks are a factor that greatly impacts tourists' travel decisions. 96% of Asia-Pacific travelers said they use social networking platforms to find information, plan and share trip itineraries.
Vietnamese visitors lead the region in using Facebook (95%) and TikTok (83%) as travel inspiration platforms. 91% of Vietnamese tourists book travel services based on recommendations and reviews from content creators on social networks. Of these, 63% of Vietnamese people access travel information through video format because of its strong visual appeal.
This trend increases by about 18% by 2023. A survey conducted in July 2023 showed that about 73% of Vietnamese people use social networks to make travel plans.
Although the reliability of online travel recommendations is increasing, famous KOLs or travel content creators on social networks receive little trust from Vietnamese tourists. Travel Pulse survey shows that 61% of Vietnamese tourists trust non-famous content creators.
Mr. Nguyen Huy Hoang, Managing Director of Klook Vietnam, explained that this trend comes from the behavior of using social networks to post photos and trip information to preserve moments. This information is more authentically shared than reviews from celebrities who are paid to advertise. Experiences shared on social networks partly influence the travel decisions of other tourists.
In addition, the survey also shows that Asia-Pacific travelers tend to prioritize experience over cost, and are willing to increase their budget to maximize their travel enjoyment in 2024. 3 out of 5 respondents are willing to spend at least 30% to 50% more on their vacation budget, compared to an estimated average travel spend of $2,000 per person by 2023. Travel Pulse survey July/ 2023 shows that tourists in the Asia-Pacific region show that one in three tourists is willing to spend more than 2,000 USD to travel.
Among them, Vietnamese tourists invest more in experiences, 17% are willing to spend more than half of their travel budget on experiential activities. Klook representatives rated this as one of the highest numbers in the area.
Vietnamese people also lead the region in demand for family travel. 3 out of 5 travelers responded that bonding with their loved ones is a priority during trips.
Mr. Nguyen Huy Hoang commented that this travel trend is a reflection of the post-pandemic world, when the isolation and digitalization that grew strongly during the pandemic now make people crave more connection. more than ever.
Travel has become an essential means of expressing love, giving individuals the opportunity to authentically connect with themselves, others and the world around them, Mr. Hoang said.
The survey also shows that in 2024, Vietnamese tourists will be the most enthusiastic travel enthusiasts in the region. 90% of Vietnamese guests said they have planned and booked a trip between now and the second half of the year. The Vietnamese market group also has the highest spontaneous travel tendency in the region when half of respondents often book travel experiences and activities only after arriving or while at the destination instead of booking a full tour. package.

Animal cafes become the center of controversy in Korea
South Korea's controversial new law restricting animal cafes could put many animals at risk of being abandoned and people losing their livelihoods.
In Korea, animal cafes have exploded in popularity over the past decade. First there are dog and cat cafes, then there are wild animals. A cafe in Hongdae University in Seoul is keeping about 40 species of animals including hedgehogs, snakes, foxes and ferrets. This place has a sign on the door advertising it as a unique date spot.
But these cafes have caused controversy. Animal rights advocates have long called for strict restrictions or outright bans on such businesses.
The growing opposition has caused the Korean government to tighten the rules with a new law effective in December 2023, banning cafes from displaying or keeping live wild animals unless registered as a business. under the zoo or aquarium model.
Experts say this is a positive step, but more is needed due to the narrow scope of the law and opposition from business owners who say their livelihoods are at risk.
Jang Ji-deok, general director of the Animal Management Department at the National Institute of Ecology, which advises the government on this issue, said that the impact of this law will be very small, due to many related problems. to the survival of businesses. However, the introduction of the law means that things are gradually getting better, with more concern for the treatment of animals.
The craze for animal cafes began to appear in Korea in the early 2010s. At a typical animal cafe, customers can enjoy drinks, freely pet and feed pets. The animal coffee model is even more attractive when diners in big cities have little opportunity to come into direct contact with wild animals.
Kang Aesol, living in Seoul, said she visited a sheep cafe and experienced playing with the "cute" animals here, helping female customers relieve stress after work. She shared that the animal at the shop seemed comfortable and showed no signs of stress or panic. Ms Kang stroked the sheep "very carefully" and mainly observed the animals from a distance.
When hearing about pet cafes, many people have prejudices about animal abuse, but after learning about this sheep cafe, I think it's a really good system. The sheep looked very healthy and did not appear nervous, Ms. Kang said.
Animal cafes are popping up more and more because they earn big profits. A representative of a pet business consulting company in Korea shared with CNN that he often advises many F&B business owners who are having financial difficulties to switch to the pet cafe model. It is estimated that a dog cafe requires a minimum investment of $40,000, but the net profit can be more than $15,000 per month.
The media and social networks also contribute to promoting the trend of coffee and animal pets models. A Samoyed dog cafe in Seoul has more than 81,000 followers on Instagram and the line often stretches all the way to the door.
As animal cafes proliferate, criticism follows. A local media report has shown that animals and pets in cafes mostly have small, cramped living spaces, many of them are stressed due to frequent touching by visitors, and some have health problems. health due to poor diet and many other shortcomings in care.
On the contrary, some businesses have animal protection regulations such as prohibiting customers from touching certain animals or not allowing children under a certain age to enter the shop. The sheep cafe in Seoul asks customers not to startle the sheep, and is equipped with a sink for customers to wash their hands before and after petting the animals.
The director general of the Department of Animal Management at the National Institute of Ecology said the new law promulgated last month reflected the government's growing concern over "instances of venomous and dangerous animals being displayed and sold indiscriminately in the country", as well as showing increasing pressure from the public.
According to new amendments to the Wildlife Protection Act, only establishments officially registered as zoos or aquariums are allowed to display "live wild animals". Animal cafes currently have four years to register as zoos or aquariums or close under the law - with a grace period intended to minimize any abandonment of animals when they cease operations.
Licensing zoos and aquariums sets certain standards for animal housing, staffing, safety and disease management, creating a better environment for animals.
However, the law has worried some business owners. Koo Jung Hwan, owner of a meerkat cafe in Seoul, said he was wondering whether to file a legal dispute, close the business or apply for a license to operate an indoor zoo. During the extension, he plans to continue operating the business but expressed concern about other cafes potentially abandoning animals after ceasing operations.
The law bans animal cafes, but has not provided any alternatives or what to do with the animals. The government should have thought of that. If my cafe has to close, I will still keep the ferrets and take care of them like family members, Koo Jung Hwan said.
On the other side of the debate, some animal activists and advocates say the law does not go far enough because it only focuses on cafes that display wild animals. This means that cafes with animals classified as "pets" or "livestock" will be exempt from the regulations, whether they keep dogs and cats or ferrets and sheep.
Experts said these exceptions "can be exploited", animal welfare laws "are not strongly enforced" in South Korea compared to some European countries. However, the government is unlikely to expand the law to include pet cafes and pets. This could lead to a decline in the animal cafe industry and small farms across the country.
The owners of these businesses have a right to exist. The enforcement of animal protection laws is like a double-edged sword, it cannot be "strong-handed" and "deprive people of their livelihoods".
Further proposals on this issue are being worked on. The government-owned National Institute of Ecology has proposed guidelines such as introducing educational programs at animal cafes, requiring visitors to wear gloves before coming into contact with animals and limiting only a minute or two of exposure to each animal.

An indispensable item in the Mong people's Tet feast is banh day made from upland sticky rice wrapped in banana leaves, similar to banh chung of the Kinh people. Banh day can be fried or grilled to eat.
Mong people believe that banh day symbolizes the Moon, the Sun, the universe, and the origin of humans and all species on earth. The bigger and rounder the cake, the fuller and more prosperous their lives will be. Banh Day is not only used for worshiping and celebrating Tet, but also as gifts for guests.
Mr. Thanh said the banh day is soft, flexible, fragrant and sweet. The cake mixed with the scent of wild dong leaves creates a typical aroma of the Northwest mountains and forests.

"Traditional New Year is important for Mong people, so avoid committing religious issues that make the homeowner unhappy," Thanh said.

Vietnamese tourists are 'dumbfounded' in front of Death Valley
The first time they came to a famous landmark in the US, Vietnamese tourists were "dumbfounded" at the majestic landscape before their eyes.
Photographer Pham Huy Trung, living in Ho Chi Minh City, visited Death Valley, located between the states of California and Nevada, last December. The tour lasts about 3 hours, passing through some of Death Valley's major destinations.
This is the largest national park among the lower 48 states, the driest in the United States. In addition, this area also achieved the world record for the hottest air temperature ever recorded (56.7 degrees Celsius) in the US on July 10, 1913.

The red patches on the rocks were captured by a Vietnamese photographer while traveling on the Artist's Drive, about 14 km long in Death Valley.
After about 8 km of driving, the Artist's Palette area will gradually appear before your eyes with strange color patches on the rocky mountain. This is the result of oxidation of metals and some other elements, creating a variety of colors from purple, blue, red or green.

Vietnamese guests were escorted by police into the worst slum in Africa
Coming to Kenya, Thai Quoc decided to go to the famous slum, where the police also had to be wary because of the bad elements armed inside.
The memories of Phan Thanh Quoc's (Ke Du Duc) trip to Kenya in September 2022 are almost intact. The smell of burning nylon, huge garbage dumps, and deformed food bags that children gobbled up, it all seems like just yesterday. The flashback takes him back to Korogocho, one of the largest slums in Kenya, an east African country.
Korogocho is about 1.5 square kilometers wide, located northeast of the capital Nairobi. Korogocho is divided into 9 areas, with almost no infrastructure to serve the people.
According to Africa News, Korogocho has about 150,000 people living in poor conditions. Because they don't have money to buy charcoal or firewood, people often burn nylon bags to cook, despite concerns about health and the environment. Sanitation services are also seriously lacking, with problems such as HIV, domestic violence, drug addiction, sexual assault, and robbery always present.
In the morning, Quoc went to meet Sommy, a friend in Kenya, to go into the slum together. Quoc said people who don't know about Korogocho are often "optimistic" and confident that they can easily come here. In fact, Korogocho has no security checkpoints, so visitors can move freely.
You can get in, but whether you get out safely or not is another matter. Sommny warned me many things when deciding to come here, he said. However, stepping foot in Korogocho is not an opportunity that everyone has in life, so Quoc is determined to make it happen.
At Sommy's suggestion, they found a police escort to ensure both of their safety. When he went to the station to present his wishes, the police were also surprised by Quoc's proposal. According to them, before that, an Indian entered Korogocho and did not return. After about 30 minutes in the station, the final plan was that two policemen would accompany Quoc and Sommy. However, they only agreed to go to the edge area, not deep into Korogocho to ensure safety.
During half of the day exploring Korogocho, Quoc spent about 10 million VND on expenses such as traveling by taxi 12 km, giving money to some people and paying for police support. The two police officers escorting Quoc are Linux and Rona, one is a muscular male police officer and the other is a slim female police officer. They are all armed with guns to be ready to face the worst situation.
The issue of illegal gun possession and use has long been a headache for Kenyan officials. In 2018, Al Jazeera (Qatar) reported that there were about 750,000 pistols and rifles in the hands of people - more than the number of the police force and army combined. The government of this country once asked people who owned illegal guns to hand them over but failed because "guns have become their life".
Previously, in Kenya, many bloody shootings in the capital Nairobi left many people dead, such as the gunfight in January 2019 and the school shooting in 2017. In Korogocho, according to the police, there are many illegal gun owners.
Sommy kept reminding: "Harry (Quoc's English name), you have to be careful, we only have two policemen and they have a lot of people."
Arriving at the edge of a garbage collection area in Korogocho, the group of four people got out of the car and went deeper so that Quoc could observe people's lives. Even from outside, he could smell the terrible stench from the piled-up garbage dumps, which if piled up on top of each other, could form an entire mountain. The children were very interested in seeing the foreigners and raised their hands to say hello. Quoc wanted to talk to them longer, but the time of the "tour" was limited. They had to leave Korogocho before dark, otherwise, "no one knew what would happen".
The dirt road is rough, trash is everywhere, and the canal is turbid because it has been contaminated for too long. There, poor Kenyans put on makeshift cloaks made of nylon and buried themselves in the water to find what they could use. Quoc commented that many people may feel terrible at this scene, but for poor people in the slums, they are willing to bathe in garbage to make a living.
Quoc meets Steve, a boss who hires workers to sort trash to sell to make money. Steve is one of the rare people who creates jobs for the people of this slum. Thanks to him, even though they were buried in trash, they had an honest job to support their family.
Leaving the fringe area, Quoc moved deeper into the "territory" of Korogocho, a place close to the "forbidden zone" that even the police were afraid of. Linux and Rona understand that Vietnamese tourists want to film the most authentic footage of life in Korogocho, but if they go too deep, they are not confident to protect him. Therefore, the whole group agreed to just go near the edge of the "restricted area", visit for a while and then immediately return to the car. Even though he didn't say much, Quoc understood that both Linux and Rona were tense. They constantly paid attention to their surroundings and "closed" the male tourist, not leaving even half a step.
If at the edge, Quoc witnessed people "swimming" in the garbage canal, here, he saw a scene that could make many people vomit. Many children are standing on a giant mountain of trash, holding plastic bags in their hands. They approached and suggested that they open it and see inside.
It's chicken but I'm not sure it looks like that. The meat was watery, mushy and deformed into something, he said. Unable to bear this scene, Quoc emptied the last coins in his pocket to share with the people around him.
The flashback ends with the smell of burning nylon in the air. Kenyans cannot find work and the only way to stay alive is to go to landfills looking for dirty things. Linux and Rona's calls signaled that time was up, and the group was forced to leave quickly on a road full of broken glass. The rotten smell of garbage and the liquid meat the children ate still lingered in his mind.
According to Quoc, his experience in Korogocho was not really dangerous, but that was because he had help from two police officers. He also doesn't regret not having gone deeper inside. For Quoc, witnessing the naked life at the outer edge of Korogocho was an unprecedented experience.

Vietnam will be the top destination for Americans because of its good USD exchange rate
When travel costs tend to increase, Americans will choose Vietnam as a priority destination thanks to the favorable USD exchange rate.
Bloomberg predicts that American tourists will consider the strength of the USD when choosing destinations in 2024 to get the best experience. Based on Bloomberg's currency ranking tool, writer Lily Girma has selected 5 attractive destinations with favorable exchange rates over the past two to three years.
Vietnam is on this list, alongside two other Asian countries, Indonesia and South Korea. The remaining two names are Colombia and Tanzania - an East African country. These results indicate 2024 is a great time to visit Asia for Americans.
According to Bloomberg, in 2023, the number of international visitors to Vietnam will be about 70% before the epidemic, expected to reach 18 million this year. Hotel brands such as JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton Reserve are considering Vietnam as a new luxury destination in the region.
When coming to Vietnam, Bloomberg writers suggest that American tourists stay in a long-standing 5-star hotel in Hanoi for about 279 USD per night, and travel on Ha Long Bay by yacht for about 526 USD per night.
Regarding exchange rates, this newspaper reports that in December 2021, 1 USD is equal to about 22,000 VND, by December 2023 it will be 24,000 VND. Meanwhile, a visit to Thien Duong and Phong Nha caves costs about 2.9 million VND - equivalent to 130 USD in 2021 and 121 USD currently, or 6.9% cheaper.
Similarly, a day of all-inclusive luxury spa experience in Ubud (Bali, Indonesia) costs about 217 USD in 2021 but is reduced to 198 USD now - or 8.7% cheaper. In Korea, with this calculation, the tasting menu at fine dining restaurant Born & Bred in Busan this year was 9.6% cheaper than in 2021.
While Japan remains a popular choice, Vietnam and South Korea are seen as notable alternatives among Asian countries with favorable exchange rates with the US dollar, according to Bloomberg.

Playing until 4am helps Thai tourism revenue increase by 44%
In December, Thai tourism revenue increased 44% over the same period last year with 1.6 billion USD, partly thanks to allowing tourists to increase their night out time.
From December 15, 2023, the Thai cabinet allows bars, nightclubs and entertainment venues to open until 4am instead of 2am as before. 5 famous locations: Bangkok, Phuket, Koh Samui, Pattaya and Chiang Mai apply this policy. The new strategy has caused thousands of tourists to stay longer and spend significantly more, according to Thai government spokesman Chai Watcharong.
Thailand earned 54.4 billion baht ($1.6 billion) from tourism in December, up 44% over the same period last year, according to the Ministry of Tourism and Sports. Sanga Ruangwattanakul, President of Khaosan Business Association, a famous night entertainment spot in Bangkok, said the government allowing businesses to open until 4am has greatly supported tourism at the end of the year.
Phuket Governor Sophon Suwannarat said the coastal town has become more vibrant and its nightlife is bustling thanks to the return of tourists. About 50,000 guests recently arrived on the island on 300 flights a day, especially for the New Year.
We expect Phuket to earn 300 billion baht (nearly 8.6 billion USD) this year, nearly equal to the amount of tourism revenue before the epidemic, Mr. Suwannarat said.
In the coastal city of Pattaya, hotels had a 90% occupancy rate as more than 320,000 tourists arrived for New Year's Eve and New Year parties. They spent about 2.6 billion baht (742 million USD) for this occasion. Mayor Poramet Ngampichet said opening until 4am has helped increase revenue at pubs and entertainment venues by 50% at the end of the year.
Thai officials say extended nights out can help maintain the growth momentum of the tourism industry, especially during the Lunar New Year. This time coincides with the long holiday of some Asian countries such as China and Vietnam. Thailand hopes the new policy will strongly attract Chinese visitors.
An official of the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) said it plans to attract more visitors from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia to compensate for the shortage of traditional visitors from mainland China.
Thailand depends heavily on tourism as the industry contributes 18% of GDP. After the epidemic, the government has made many moves to revive and support tourism businesses. The latest move is long-term bilateral visa exemption with China.
In 2023, Thailand will welcome 28 million international visitors, reaching the set target. The five largest tourist markets to Thailand are Malaysia (4.4 million), China (3.4 million), Korea (1.6 million), India (1.5 million) and Russia (1.4 million). million). However, the number of 28 million is still much lower than the 39.8 million international visitors of 2019.

Simon Cockerell, general manager of Koryo Tours based in Beijing, China, said partners in North Korea confirmed the above information and said this trip was a special tour.

North Korea is one of the Asian countries with the strictest Covid-19 control measures and has not yet fully reopened to international visitors.

Three days of encountering the 'Amazon forest killers' of Vietnamese guests
Peru
During his days living in the Amazon forest, Mr. Hieu met three famous "assassins": anaconda, caiman and piranha.
Hoang Phung Hieu, 41 years old, in Hanoi, went on a 14-day trip to Ecuador and Peru at the end of November 2023. He spent 3 days living in the Amazon forest - the largest rain forest in the world with an area of ​​more than 5.5 million square kilometers. The Amazon basin is located in the territory of 9 South American countries including Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Rurinam and French Guyana. The Amazon region he visited is in Peru.
The first killer Hieu encountered was anaconda, a native South American green python. According to NatGeo, anacondas living in the wild can be more than 9 meters long, weigh as much as a school bus and are one of the largest python species in the world. George, Hieu's tour guide, said large pythons are very rare. Scientists have to spend a long time and go deep into the forest to encounter this species.
Reticulated pythons, anacondas or African rock pythons have the ability to attack quickly and easily strangle to death, or even swallow fellow humans or humans. There have been two cases of man-eating reticulated pythons recorded in Indonesia, according to Newsflare.
The anaconda Mr. Hieu saw with his own eyes was a python raised in an indigenous village, located next to the Amazon River and about 15-20 minutes by motorboat from the hotel. The python was as big as an adult's wrist and "not as scary as on TV". Mr. Hieu was introduced to two green and red pythons and was instructed by the breeder how to put the python on his shoulder and take pictures.
People in the village are self-sufficient, fishing, growing rice, bananas, coconuts, and raising chickens and pigs. When they need household items, they will load the agricultural products they have on a motorboat and take them to Quito to exchange. People make more handicrafts such as plaiting wool in the shape of sloths to sell to customers.
On the second night in the forest, Mr. Hieu went on a tour to hunt black caiman crocodiles on the river. The tour guide sailed the motorboat close to the shore, shining a light into the bushes near the water's edge to search. He said it takes a very sharp eye to see a crocodile with red eyes. "The tour guide told me there are caimans up to 13 meters long," Mr. Hieu said.
Listverse, a news website and partner of CNN and BBC, ranks this animal in the top 10 ferocious sea monsters on the Amazon River. It can eat anything nearby, including anacondas. In 2010, biologist Deise Nishimura lost a leg fighting a black caima crocodile after eight months the animal hid under her boat. However, the crocodile hunt that night did not scare Mr. Hieu. His tour guide said that crocodiles are not the type to attack when they see a human and that guests are guaranteed safety when participating in the tour.
After hunting crocodiles, the tour guide turns off the lights and stops the motorboat for about two minutes for tourists to watch the stars. Thousands of stars in the sky illuminate the river, surrounded by the sound of insects chirping. "The Milky Way is the most beautiful I have ever seen, gorgeous," Mr. Hieu said.
On the third day, he followed George to a small tributary of the Amazon River to fish for piranhas. According to CNN, piranhas specialize in using their teeth to chew bones and tear flesh, like kitchen knives. However, they rarely go crazy for food and attack humans, unless disturbed while mating or protecting eggs during the rainy season. George said piranhas are not found everywhere on the river.
The tourist group was asked to wear life jackets and stop on a stretch of river to fish. While other fish need to be kept still, piranhas are only attracted to rough waters. Therefore, every time he fishes, George uses his rod to hit the water surface many times to attract this fish. "Each tour guide caught piranhas. We all caught other types of fish," said a Vietnamese male tourist.
Hieu's group enjoyed crispy fried piranhas for lunch. Piranha fish is "similar to plaice in Vietnam" and the taste is similar, according to the male tourist.
While on the boat, Mr. Hieu first saw South American parrots with colorful feathers and falcons and found it interesting because he had always thought South American parrots were big. "The things I thought were big were actually very small, the animals I thought were small were actually very big," Mr. Hieu said.
The three tours Mr. Hieu participated in all followed the program of the Treehouse Lodge hotel where he stayed. This is one of the 10 most unique tree houses in the world, located next to the Amazon River, with 8 bungalow suites and accessible by motorboat. Each house is built with a diameter of 5 m, has fences, curtains to block insects, a system of vines, and wooden stairs for guests to climb. The rooms are connected by wooden suspension bridges and are far enough apart to create a private space. Room prices start from more than 16 million VND, according to Booking.
Mr. Hieu was impressed with the "natural" way of building tree houses. Instead of cutting down trees in the forest to make room for a house, rooms at a height of a few tens to hundreds of meters do not cause damage to the tree trunks. The hotel owner is an American businessman. Every year, he comes to the hotel 1-2 times with a group of experts and architects to maintain the houses.
Mr. Hieu said the Amazon forest and river system is "similar to Vietnam" because they share the same ecosystem, the rain forest. "The tourists who came with me said that the scenery of rivers and forests is no different from Tien Giang and Hau Giang," Mr. Hieu said. However, Amazon is larger and more majestic.
Regarding eating, Mr. Hieu sees "nothing different from the rest of the world". "Many people ask me if I can eat wild animal specialties in the Amazon. We eat European food and local food like fish caught from the river. Here people do not hunt wild animals," Mr. Hieu said.
The trip was a memorable experience for him because it fulfilled his goal of visiting the new 7 natural wonders of the world voted by New 7 Wonders. The remaining 6 wonders include: Ha Long Bay in Vietnam, Jeju Island in Korea, Iguazu waterfall in Brazil and Argentina, Table Mountain in South Africa, Komodo Island in Indonesia, Puerto Princesa underground river in the Philippines. The three wonders of Ha Long Bay, Jeju Island and Ban Mountain Mr. Hieu set foot on many years ago. The remaining 4 wonders he visited from August 2022 until now.
The only negative point of the trip is "flying too long" with a total time of 30 hours one way, continuously transiting 2-3 places. "But keep going and you will come," he said.
He found Peru did a "very good" job of protecting its rainforests and ecosystems. They do not hunt wild animals to make "specialties" to serve customers, but the food is transported from the city to the forest to protect the environment. "You have to go to know that our world is very beautiful and we need to join hands to protect it so that the planet remains beautiful," Mr. Hieu said.

China has a boom in ice and snow tourism
China
Harbin and Xinjiang are considered two bright stars of winter tourism in China, reviving local tourism revenue after the pandemic.
After more than 4 years, winter tourism in China returned and marked a strong recovery. Harbin city in Heilongjiang province and Xinjiang autonomous region are the two top tourist attractions in China this winter. Revenue from tourism in these two cities in the last days of 2023 and early 2024 increased clearly after more than 4 years of freezing due to the pandemic.
Popular fun activities in winter at the two locations are skiing on the slopes and participating in ice festivals.
Data from online travel platform Ctrip shows that the number of pre-booked ski experience tickets for the end of 2023 in Heilongjiang and Xinjiang doubled compared to 2023. While the number of ski group tour bookings snow increased nearly 30%.
Also in the last month of 2023, Harbin skyrocketed to become China's top winter destination. The name Harbin is heavily covered on social networking sites, and Chinese media also take the opportunity to continuously expand the scope of coverage of this city's tourism boom.
A report on tourism in northern and northeast China predicts that tourist arrivals this spring will increase by 25% to 30% compared to last year. The number of tourists visiting Heilongjiang and Xinjiang could exceed 400 million, likely generating revenue of up to 550 billion yuan ($77.2 billion).
In Harbin, the ice festival opened from December 17, 2023, lasting until early January 2024, attracting more than three million tourists to the city during the New Year holidays. This festival displays sculptures carved from ice blocks harvested from the Songhua River. The festival opened in 1963 and is one of the largest and oldest ice and snow festivals in the world.
Ms. Jin Honglan, Chief Financial Officer of Yabuli Ski Resort in Harbin, said the number of visitors here has doubled compared to previous years and tourist attractions around the city are now very crowded.

The CEO at Keketuohai International Ski Resort in Xinjiang told People's Daily that this year's winter is "much more exciting" than in previous years. The resort has welcomed an average of 2,000 guests per day since October until now.
The number of tourists flocking to winter snow and ice tourist destinations leads to increased demand for accommodation. Many tourists complained on social networks about the skyrocketing prices of many rural inns in Heilongjiang. Some places charge 3,000 yuan (equivalent to 10 million VND) per night for a bedroom with only a pair of mattresses on the floor.
In the 5-year tourism development plan, China focuses on promoting ice and snow tourism activities in winter such as opening more ski resorts and exploiting local culture and traditions in cold regions.
Heilongjiang Province plans to take advantage of its ice and snow resources and turn it into an international winter tourist destination. Local authorities in Xinjiang's Altay region have accelerated investment of about 550 million yuan ($77 million) in ski runs and park projects, opening new hotels and launching more direct flights. from Guangzhou and Beijing.

Massage at the temple - an experience that attracts tourists in Thailand
Massage at a temple in Chiang Mai is cheap, making this place always full of tourists and locals.
On a cool January morning in Chiang Mai, many people get up early to jog by the city's moat, passing by sidewalk fruit sellers. Juicy red strawberries are the food most people buy.
At the same time, there were many activities taking place at temples in the city. In the courtyard of Wat Pan Whaen, young monks sweep fallen leaves into neat piles after cleaning the entrance steps. Two women place incense sticks, bananas and lotus flowers next to a golden statue. People come to worship the Buddha statue, clasp their hands, touch their nose with their fingertips and pray for a good day.
A few minutes later, the first guests appeared on a tuk tuk. Wat Pan Whaen is one of 300 temples in Chiang Mai but is also a massage center that attracts Thais and tourists looking to relieve aches and pains.
There is a main room with 14 beds for guests to lie on for massages, but there are no curtains. The time customers have to wait is often long because of the crowd and the low price. The therapists are highly skilled and have seniority. A guest who was getting a massage just made a video call to his family and boasted: "I'm getting a massage in the temple."
The amount of money collected during the day from customers coming to massage in the temple is divided into three: for the temple, the manager and the massage staff.
Recognized by UNESCO as part of its intangible cultural heritage, Thai massage evolved from an ancient healing method that dates back 2,500 years. In 2020, Thailand's Ministry of Public Health estimated there were at least 10,000 massage shops nationwide and were the first businesses ordered to close during the pandemic.
Four years later, many facilities have reopened. Strolling on the streets of Chiang Mai, visitors will encounter countless multilingual signs offering aromatherapy massage services, herbal compresses and physical therapy, and neck and shoulder acupressure.
Massage techniques at Wat Pan Whaen are controversial. Some praised this place as great and the best physical therapy place in the country. Others are less dissatisfied with the basic technology, nothing special. The biggest complaint is the lack of air conditioning, especially during the summer months. However, if you want to go to luxurious, cool places, the price is more expensive, 1,000 baht (700,000 VND) per trip. Meanwhile, the price for a massage at the temple is 180 baht (125,000 VND) and the toilet is not clean.
The low price makes the service attractive to both Thais and tourists. A Canadian guest said that his girlfriend spent the whole morning searching online for the cheapest massage place in Chiang Mai and accidentally found Wat Pan Whaen. She was satisfied because she did not need to pay extra tips.

Global analysts point out that by 2024 air ticket prices will tend to decrease slightly but remain high.

The Middle East is expected to have positive financial results in 2023 and 2024, followed by Europe despite war and conflict. took place in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip. Asia-Pacific this year brings profits to airlines thanks to the return of Chinese and Indian tourists. Latin America and Africa are two regions that will be difficult to recover in 2024 because of economic, social and infrastructure instability.

IATA predicts that airline industry revenue and profits will increase this year to 964 billion USD, with net profit to be 25.7 billion USD. Net profit margin increased by 2.7% compared to before the epidemic and in 2023 increased by 2.6%. However, according to experts, the net profit margin of 2.7% is still much lower than the level that investors in other industries "can accept".

More and more tourists are being fined for smoking in Japan
The number of tourists violating the smoking ban in Japan is increasing, mostly due to ignorance of this regulation.
A ban on smoking both indoors and on streets was issued in Japan in April 2020. Specifically, visitors are only allowed to smoke in designated areas. In addition, walking and smoking is also prohibited because it can cause burns or discomfort to people around you. This regulation applies nationwide, including localities that are tourist destinations.
Famous tourist destinations that attract a large number of tourists such as Nara Park have also implemented a ban on outdoor smoking since 2009. The on-the-spot fine for violators is 1,000 yen (6.9 USD).
Similarly, in 2007, central areas of Osaka city, including Minami district, a destination that attracts a large number of tourists, also introduced their own regulations on smoking. Mobile security forces will regularly check and be empowered to impose fines of 1,000 yen for violations by tourists. In 2022, this city recorded 4,225 violations of the smoking ban.
In Kyoto, 40% of people fined in 2019 for smoking in illegal places were foreign visitors. Foreign visitors accounted for 10% of violations in Kobe city in the same year.
According to Mr. Hiro Miyatake, founder of the network of luxury travel companies Bear Luxe Corp, visitors to Japan are interested in cultural traditions and respect the law here. However, only a few understand and know about the regulations. He further cited the smoking ban as not many tourists know that walking and smoking at the same time is a violation and they are required to go to the smoking area. Some visitors said they had difficulty finding smoking areas and just "wanted to smoke, not disrespecting the rules".
Mr. Miyatake suggested that there should be more information for tourists about these regulations. Specifically, announcements can be made on the app in many different languages, or at tourist attractions, they should provide detailed information about designated smoking areas and introductions to bars, restaurants, and other establishments. Other facilities have designated areas for smokers.
Sharing the same opinion, Mr. Ashley Harvey, a tourism marketing analyst who has worked for 15 years in the Japanese tourism industry, also believes that the country's tourism industry should clearly inform foreign tourists about attraction regulations. cigarette. According to him, the best way to solve the problem is to constantly remind tourists in a gentle way so that they understand Japan's message, even if it takes a lot of time.
Unfortunately, many Japanese are unhappy with the return of large numbers of tourists to some popular cities such as Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka. The fact that foreign visitors often violate smoking regulations may also be a reason why locals oppose mass tourism, Mr. Harvey shared.
However, according to this person, many Japanese people sometimes violate the rules by walking and smoking, so people must also seriously implement the regulations to help tourists be more aware at tourist destinations.

Passengers fly domestically but land overseas
The male passenger flew from Tampa to Cleveland, USA, but was taken to Puerto Rico.
Jennifer de la Cruz, representative of Frontier Airlines, confirmed that passenger Logan Lose, 16 years old, flew from Tampa to Cleveland, USA, at the end of December 2023 but landed in San Juan, Puerto Rico. "Frontier has sincerely apologized for this error," Cruz said. According to airline representatives, flights to Cleveland and Puerto Rico depart from the same boarding gate. The flight to Puerto Rico took off first and Logan got on by mistake.
Ryan Lose, Logan's father, said his son had a fear of flying and this was his first time flying alone. When he arrived at the boarding gate, Logan showed him his ticket and asked the airline staff to make sure he was on the right flight. But the staff just glanced and nodded.
If they scanned his boarding pass, they would find out he was on the wrong flight, the father said. At 8:30 p.m., Logan was seated on the plane and called his parents. Ryan discovered that his child had boarded the plane too early. When Logan's younger brother checked the flight status online, he discovered that another flight to Puerto Rico was preparing to depart at the same boarding gate as Logan's.
Ryan immediately called his son to warn him, but it was too late. They had to call the airline to report the mistake at 8:40 p.m. At 10:15 p.m. the same day, the airline called Ryan and said it had contacted the pilot on the flight monitoring Logan. The 16-year-old male passenger was taken back to Tampa shortly thereafter. The next day, Logan was taken to Cleveland as originally planned. "This ordeal has been stressful for all of us," Lose said.
This is not the first time American passengers intended to fly to one place but were instead taken to another. A passenger once mistakenly boarded a Spirit Airlines flight and arrived in Orlando instead of Ft. Myers.

But the dream was shattered in the minutes of violent shaking on New Year's Day, when the strongest earthquake to hit Japan in 13 years and multiple aftershocks devastated the city, claiming thousands of lives. dozens of people. Among the most severely damaged buildings was the 9-story Koshuen hotel - where Wakabayashi worked.
The total loss of life and property in the area due to the strongest earthquake of 7.6 magnitude has not yet been estimated. But it's clear that Wajima, famous for its fishing, lacquerware and markets, faces a long road to recovery.
Wakabayashi said the tourism industry has just recovered from the Covid-19 crisis. He fears the earthquake could be a major blow. "It's really bad," the 62-year-old chef said as he sat crammed into the three-story building of a post-earthquake evacuation center. Here, many people sleep on plastic sheets or tatami mats.
Nearby is the Koshuen Hotel, one of the city's largest accommodation centers and with a hot spring overlooking the sea. The top floors were the most damaged, with walls peeling off and ceilings collapsing. Wakabayashi said it will take six months to a year to fully refurbish.
Tourism is the bright spot of the Japanese economy in 2023 when the country opens to welcome visitors. The number of visitors in October last year exceeded the same period in 2019 for the first time.
Wajima, about 450 km northwest of Tokyo, has always been a popular tourist attraction in the country. A 15-minute walk from Koshuen and near the evacuation center is Asaichi, a 1,000-year-old shopping district with about 200 stalls selling seafood, snacks, and crafts. Much of the market was destroyed after a fire caused by the earthquake.
The Asaichi morning market in Wajima is one of the top three markets in Japan, Wakabayashi said. The fire almost destroyed all the goods and homes of the people living there just as the crab harvest season was about to arrive.
The male chef said he was "luckier than many residents in the city who lost their homes" when living in an apartment provided by the hotel. However, Wakabayashi is still facing difficulties due to salary cuts during the epidemic and now has an unstable job due to natural disasters.
Tourists will definitely return, but the hotel needs expensive repairs. I'm not sure if the hotel will be able to retain staff anymore, Wakabayashi said.

Experts are optimistic that this year China will fully recover, returning to being the world's number one tourism market like in 2019.
China's international tourism recovery in 2023 is slower than expected but many experts expect a full recovery this year. The latest data from the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) shows that the outbound market (Chinese tourists traveling internationally) recovers about 55% of pre-epidemic levels in the third quarter of 2023. According to the OAG report, the supplier Global tourism data based in the UK, in November 2023, the number of passengers traveling domestically by China exceeded 11% compared to the same period in 2019. The number of international flight tickets was equal to 57%.
Oliver Sedlinger, an international tourism consultant in Beijing, predicts China has a positive outlook in 2024 as well as the importance of re-establishing connectivity and updating market trends. Sedlinger assesses that the Chinese market has great potential. "Observing the market and understanding the travel preferences of Chinese tourists is very meaningful," he said.
Wolfgang Arlt, director of the China International Tourism Research Institute, expects fierce competition between China, the US and Germany for the title of the world's largest outbound tourism source market. He assessed that all three countries are "equal" in terms of competitiveness in 2023 but leans towards China in 2024. Arlt believes that China will definitely return to lead the world, with the number of tourist arrivals. close to 2019 levels.

Self-guided tours and specialized services tailored to specific interests are also attracting attention. These trends are especially prominent among guests born in 1990 and after 2000 - the generation that likes to travel independently.

Negligence caused tourists to lose nearly 5,000 USD in ticket costs
Instead of filling in his full name when booking a plane ticket online, the male tourist wrote down his wife's nickname, causing her to spend another 4,700 USD to buy a new ticket.
Phil and Kate, a couple living in Queensland, Australia, were very excited for a vacation to England to visit relatives and to travel to Europe for a month. In July 2023, Phil bought plane tickets online for the couple through an app. When filling in the details on the ticket, Phil accidentally wrote down his wife's nickname, Kate, instead of the name on her birth certificate, Katherine. They flew from Brisbane to Melbourne with Virgin, then from Melbourne to London, transiting in Doha with Qatar Airways, and the round-trip ticket cost was 2,400 USD.
On the day of departure, Virgin Airlines realized that the names on the ticket and Kate's passport did not match. She cannot board the plane without correcting the error. Most airlines usually charge a small fee for name change errors, but if purchased through third-party ticket booking apps, this fee may be higher.
The ticketing application asked the female tourist to cancel the original ticket and receive a small refund. Afterwards, Kate bought a new ticket. Because I bought the ticket at the last minute, the price doubled from the original price, 4,700 USD. "The ticket seller said there was no time to help us correct the name on the ticket but there was time to sell new tickets," Phil said.
Two tourists called the ticket booking party to plead but to no avail. In the end, they had to spend $4,700 for a round-trip ticket. That was all the money the couple brought with them to spend on the vacation.
Phil took responsibility for the incident because he was the one who filled in the wrong information. But they felt "treated unfairly" when the ticketing application did not help them change their name and charged them but instead forced them to buy new tickets. This solution costs customers more.
The representative of the ticket seller said "it is obliged to comply with the policies set by the airlines". In the case of the Australian tourist couple, changing the name and paying an additional fee was "not allowed". Their only option is to cancel the ticket and buy it again.
We advise all passengers to carefully review the information when booking their tickets and notify them immediately of any name errors, the ticketing app said.

Common reasons why tourists fail their visas
Some causes during the visa application process can be completely avoided, as long as visitors are careful and honest when making applications.
Many tourists have economic conditions, but when applying for a visa to travel abroad, they encounter difficulties and are rejected. When embassies send visa refusal letters, most tourists only know in general terms "there are doubts about returning to Vietnam", "the purpose of entry is not reliable". The reasons why tourists are rejected are relatively diverse, but most of them can be avoided if you have a real purpose and ability for traveling abroad.
Messy profile
Preparing documents is putting the key into the "visa lock". Good records mean you can put the right key in the lock, and vice versa.
First, you need to carefully read the instructions for preparing a visa application on the official website of the country's embassies in Vietnam. Usually this guide has a complete list of necessary documents, the quantity of each type, whether it needs to be notarized or not, whether it is necessary to submit originals or not, and what size card photo needs to be taken. If you follow the instructions exactly, your application will meet more than half of the requirements.
However, many tourists are still confused when preparing documents: they need to submit notarized copies in English but only submit notarized copies in Vietnamese, if they need to submit salary slips with red stamps, they only need to submit photocopies, and card photos need to be taken with a white background. Then he submitted a photo with a green background, requested a high level of travel insurance, but mistakenly bought a low insurance package.
Arranging documents in the correct order in the instructions is also a way to get points in the eyes of visa approvers. There are tourists who submit dozens of pages of documents but arrange them haphazardly, making the reviewer impatient or unable to read all the documents, increasing the risk of visa failure.
Information does not match
A basic requirement of applying for a visa is that all information in the documents must match. Many tourists are not careful so they provide false information, and even a slight deviation can make the purpose of the trip suspect. For example: the period on the insurance certificate does not match the departure and return flight times, the number of days of hotel reservation is less or more than the number of days you are in the country, the time on your leave certificate is shorter duration of the trip.
To have accurate, consistent and transparent documents is not difficult, you just need to be meticulous and focused during the application process. The visa application form needs to be filled out completely and carefully, all information such as date of birth, passport number, household address needs to match every letter and number as your original documents.
Travel history is too thin
It is not a deciding factor, but the fact that you have been to many countries before will be a plus point for your visa application. If the first time you go abroad and hold a plain white passport to apply for a visa from countries with high requirements such as the US, Australia or Europe, your ability to get a visa may be affected.
Therefore, in your first "abroad" trips, you can go to neighboring Southeast Asian countries, which have visa-free policies for Vietnamese tourists and are also quite attractive such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Cambodia. , followed by South Asian, East Asian, and Northeast Asian countries with favorable visa policies such as India, China, Korea, and Japan. When your travel history is relatively thick, it will be easier for you to apply for visas from countries with high requirements.
Financial or identity proof is unclear
Many tourists think that being rich, having a family and a career makes it easy to get a visa. In fact, tourists who do not have high income, are single, and do not even work in an agency or organization can still apply for a tourist visa, as long as they prove their finances and identity clearly.
On your profile, you need to show that you have enough money to pay for the trip and have a healthy personal financial life. It is not necessary that you have many savings books, red books, or vehicle documents, but on the personal account statement (issued by the bank), there should be a monthly income and expenditure level commensurate with the amount of money intended to be spent. for the trip. Many tourists apply for a European visa but their monthly spending account is only a few million VND, so the person approving the visa cannot trust that person has enough money to travel and has a real travel purpose.
Students, freelancers can absolutely apply for a visa, and need to prove their identity clearly with all useful documents, showing that you are living a stable life in Vietnam: study card students, certificates, certificates of merit, certificates through competitions or community activities you have participated in, products or services you are providing, sales pages you are managing, letters of recommendation Referral from the person who is cooperating or hiring you to work. These documents are often not included in the embassy's request list, but the more you add, the better to increase the visa applicant's trust in you.
Lazy to schedule
On travel forums and groups, you can often come across tourists asking for itineraries to copy into their visa applications. This is a mistake that can easily cause your visa to be rejected, because it is easy to miss or confuse details in the schedule. That schedule was not created by you, you will not see the unreasonableness.
Scheduling is very important for every trip, so take the time to prepare in detail and completely. The visa reviewer will look at it to evaluate whether your true purpose in this trip is tourism or not, whether you are serious or not. The schedule is reasonable and as detailed as possible: which airline to fly to that country, flight number, flight time to and from Vietnam, where you travel between locations by train or car, each How long to visit the city, hotel address in each place, address of each attraction, ticket price, opening and closing hours. Some tourists who only make a very simple itinerary still get their visa, because other factors in the application are "strong" enough. If your profile is thin, a detailed schedule is important.
Lazy to write a visa application letter
Similar to the trip itinerary, many tourists just want to copy the visa application letter from online to put it in their complete application without knowing that it is a big minus point. Writing a letter is relatively simple, you just need to clearly state the purpose of your trip, why you chose that country as your destination, and commit to returning after the end of your journey. Within a single page, you can create trust for the person reviewing your application with your sincerity and honesty - that is the most important condition for you to pass a visa.

A representative of the cruise line said that after negative reactions in July 2023 about the design, the number of guests booking rooms on the ship that week "increased the highest in history".
Since its completion, Icon of the Seas has taken away the title of the world's largest cruise ship from Wonder of the Seas, another Royal Caribbean ship, 362 meters long with 18 floors.

Tours to Europe, Japan, and Taiwan sell well during the Lunar New Year
The long vacation time makes tourists decide to choose high-end tours to go far during the 2024 Lunar New Year.
According to many travel agencies, the 7-day 2024 Lunar New Year holiday helps tourists have more diverse destination choices, especially remote, high-priced destinations.
Ms. Tran Phuong Linh, Director of Marketing and Information Technology of BenThanh Tourist, said that currently, a part of customers tends to tighten their spending. Therefore, businesses will focus strongly on the mid-range and high-range customer segments to optimize business efficiency. Tourism products serving this segment of customers are also carefully invested, with classy and luxurious service quality.
At the end of 2023, Google released a report on the overall situation of Vietnam, showing that groups of people with high spending levels spend an average of 5.4 times more than groups of people with lower spending levels. In terms of tourism, the high spending group spends 4.9 times more than the low spending group.
As of the afternoon of January 3, the company's statistics showed that the Lunar New Year tour to Europe (priced at 90-125 million VND), Australia (about 68 million VND), and Dubai (about 45 million VND) is currently only available. Accept 1-3 guests per group. The tour to explore Egypt also only has 5 seats left. Northeast Asia routes such as Taiwan, Japan, Korea, and Mainland China (price 18-37 million VND) are booked by many customers. Among these, the Japanese tour was fully booked early and had to open an additional tour, departing on the 2nd day of Tet.
Viet Travel Company confirmed that it will stop accepting guests on tours as far away as the US, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia because there is enough space. They have now entered the stage of preparing services for groups. Best Price also recorded that the most booked foreign tours are mid- to high-priced products such as Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Australia and Europe. Taiwan tours alone account for 40% of the total number of foreign tours sold on this occasion.
However, according to some companies, purchasing power for Southeast Asian products is quite slow this year, especially in places like Cambodia, Singapore, Philippines, and Bali (Indonesia). However, tours to Thailand are still popular and are almost sold out because of their diverse experiences, low prices, and availability with Vietnamese tourists.
Ms. Tran Thi Bao Thu, Director of Marketing and Communications Department of Vietlux Travel Company, said Tet tour prices increase about 5-15% compared to normal times, not much different from every year. Domestic routes during the Tet season are less competitive than foreign routes due to increased domestic travel demand and transportation costs accounting for a large proportion of domestic tour prices.
Currently, Vietlux has completed 80% of its business plan with the foreign tour line. Foreign tours account for about 60% of the company's total Lunar New Year tours. According to Ms. Thu, during peak seasons, air ticket prices on foreign routes also increase but at a stable level, around 5%, land tour prices do not change much. This helps travel businesses easily regulate their business plans.
This company expects domestic tourism to have a synchronized campaign, with incentives on airfares and many other services such as restaurants, hotels, attractions, and transportation to positively impact tour prices. , customer needs, increasing the competitiveness of the domestic tour market.
A representative of Vietnam Tourism shared that during peak periods like Lunar New Year, it is difficult to expect low airfare prices. The situation of flying domestically being more expensive than flying abroad continues. Typically, for tours from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi and visits to the northern provinces, round-trip airfares range around 7 million VND per person. The package tour price is about more than 10 million VND per person, nearly equal to a 5-day, 4-night tour to Thailand (cost about 11 million VND per person).
A representative of BenThanh Tourist said that currently domestic tours have been sold about 60%, and expect positive changes in the near future because customers often book close to the date. According to Ms. Linh, the trend of choosing domestic tourist destinations focuses on beautiful natural landscapes, unique cultural experiences and many entertainment activities for family groups. Therefore, northern and island tours are still the top choice.
However, due to the impact of the economic recession, tourists have been more frugal with their spending. Tour price factors are considered more carefully by tourists before deciding, and products with good prices and stimulating demand will be more attractive. Some tourists will choose days or flight times off-peak during Tet to get better prices.

Ba Den Mountain - a spiritual destination at the end of the year
Tay Ninh
Thousands of Buddhists and people across the country come to Ba Den Mountain to perform year-end spiritual rituals and enjoy the beautiful scenery of the relic site.
The thanksgiving ceremony represents the spiritual concept of "if you borrow, you pay" of the ancient Vietnamese. In addition to the desire to "pay back", Vietnamese people often make pilgrimages to temples and pagodas at the end of the year with the desire to find peace, get rid of the troubles of the old year, and pray for luck in the new year.
Ba Den Mountain (Tay Ninh) is one of the spiritual destinations that attracts people across the country on this occasion. In the last month of the lunar year, the 986 m high mountain of the Southeast region welcomed a large number of people to worship at the 300-year-old Linh Son Tien Thach Pagoda to give thanks to Linh Son Holy Mother Bodhisattva.
In the South, Tay Ninh is known as the holy land of pilgrimage, with two famous spiritual destinations: Ba Den Mountain and the Holy See of Cao Dai religion.
On Ba Den Mountain, Ba Pagoda is a famous pagoda, associated with the legendary Linh Son Thanh Mau. For Southern people, Ba Den Mountain is a "wish-fulfilling" mountain, Linh Son Thanh Mau is a spiritual fulcrum to convey hope and faith.
According to statistics from Sun World Ba Den Mountain Tourist Area, in the last days of the year, every day thousands of visitors take the cable car to the Pagoda and the top of the mountain. On January 1 alone, 20,700 visitors took the cable car to the Pagoda and the top of the mountain to give thanks at the end of the year and join in the New Year's atmosphere on the top of the mountain.
At the beginning of the year, I go to ask for blessings from the Lady, but at the end of the year, no matter how busy I am, I still have to arrange time to go to Ba Den Mountain to pay my respects, said Mr. Pham Van Thuc (HCMC).
Ms. Ngoc Khanh (Long An) said that Ba Den Mountain is a place she comes to worship many times a year. "My wishes are sometimes fulfilled, sometimes not. But the important thing for me is that when I come here, I always feel light and peaceful, like I have found my support," Ms. Khanh said. .
At Ba Den Mountain, people pay their respects at the Ba Pagoda area with 6 pagodas scattered from the foot of the mountain to the middle of the mountain, especially Dien Ba in a stone cave with the main hall being the jade statue of Linh Son Thanh Mau. People also go to the top of the mountain to offer lanterns to say goodbye to the old year and pray for good things for the new year.
Lantern offering is a ritual held on major holidays of the year at Ba Den Mountain such as Ba Mountain Spring Festival, Buddha's Birthday, Vu Lan Ceremony, Mid-Autumn Festival... This ritual is held regularly in the last month. year for people to give thanks and offer prayers for a peaceful new year. Amidst the magical space on the top of the mountain, thousands of lanterns sparkle with wishes written by people on the lamps, lit and released on the water in the square at the foot of the Tay Bo Da Son Buddha statue.
The lantern offering ceremony along with a system of unique spiritual works and a spring-filled space make Ba Den Mountain an attractive pilgrimage destination, where tourists seek peace.
Sun World Ba Den Mountain applies a preferential cable car ticket price policy on the occasion of the 64th anniversary of Ben Tre Dong Khoi Day to be held in Ho Chi Minh City on January 6-7, while creating convenience for people. pilgrims.

China struggles to attract international visitors as tourism recovers weakly
China is trying to attract international visitors with relaxation and visa-free programs after the tourism industry's weak recovery from the pandemic.
China's bilateral visa exemption with Thailand from early March is the latest move in Beijing's efforts to attract international visitors. China's Foreign Ministry said visa exemption "serves the fundamental interests of both countries".
As the second largest economy and fourth largest area in the world with a rich culture and history, China has become a tourist destination considered "extremely useful to explore". However, this country is not the easiest place to travel.
Previously, China's visa policies for international visitors were considered "labyrinthine", famous online tools like Google Maps were not popular. Most recently, this country's electronic payment applications received many complaints about being "unfriendly to foreigners". China is also one of the countries in the world that opened its borders late after the epidemic. The above factors contribute to creating major barriers for China to attract international visitors.
After the epidemic, this country is planning to attract tourists again. In addition to bilateral visa exemption with Thailand, China also previously relaxed visa policies for 6 countries: France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and Malaysia. The policy will be applied from December 2023, valid for one year.
In December, there were nearly 120,000 visitors from the six visa-free countries mentioned above, according to the country's Immigration Department. More than 77% of them came for sightseeing, entertainment, and business, an increase of nearly 30% compared to November.
China also makes it easier for American tourists to visit by simplifying the visa application process. From January 1, US citizens do not need to submit proof of purchasing round-trip air tickets, hotel reservations, sightseeing itineraries, or invitation letters to apply for a visa.
The reason China seeks to attract more international visitors is partly to boost the sluggish economy after the epidemic. In August 2023, China removed the requirement for visitors to enter the country to be tested for Covid-19, and exempted fingerprints for visitors from some countries.
In the summer of 2023, WeChat and Alipay, the two largest payment apps in the country, finally allowed customers to use their credit cards to pay when visiting China. Thanks to that, tourists can book taxis, buy subway tickets and pay for restaurants, hotels, and shops.
According to assessments from tourism experts, the actual effectiveness of the above policies "remains to be seen" because long-distance tourists like Europe often tend to plan trips 6 months in advance. Chinese winters are also particularly cold, so the beginning and end of the year are usually not peak seasons.
Currently, international visitors to China are still much lower than pre-pandemic levels. In the first half of 2023, the Immigration Department recorded 8.4 million international visitors entering and exiting, nearly 30% compared to the same period in 2019. In the third quarter of last year, the number of visitors increased to 8 million but still only 50% compared to the same period before the epidemic. Chinese travel companies also witnessed a "shocking" decline in the number of international visitors, serving a total of just over 477,000 international visitors, equal to 5.58% over the same period in 2019, and did not announce the number. data for the second half of last year.

Vietnam tourism 2024 - still challenging guests to leave home
Experts say that Vietnamese tourism in 2024 will still have many challenges if bottlenecks in 2023 such as air tickets are not removed, causing tourists to continue to leave their home country.
According to Ms. Dinh Thi Thu Thao, Commercial Director of Mustgo, a booking platform with 2,000 partners nationwide, the domestic tourism situation in 2024 will still face many challenges. Ms. Thao commented that the tourism industry will continue to recover, but during the economic recession, customers tend to tighten their spending.
Some large airlines such as Bamboo Airways or smaller airlines such as Pacific Airlines and Vietravel Airlines have also cut many planes and routes to major tourist destinations such as Phu Quoc, Nha Trang, Quy Nhon, causing airfare prices to increase. high, difficult to reach. In addition, air ticket prices may increase when the new ceiling is applied from March 1, 2024.
Information from Mustgo's partners shows that to cope with this, many hotels in coastal areas have launched early promotion and stimulus programs, hoping that the number of visitors will not decrease compared to 2023.
I think domestic destinations that depend on flights will face difficulties, especially when going abroad is increasingly easy and the cost is not too high, Ms. Thao said.
Marketing Director Bui Thanh Tu of Best Price predicts domestic tourists will shift to road trips, lasting 1-2 nights. The lack of accommodation causes the occupancy rate of hotels to be significantly low.
Mr. Tu also pointed out that poor nightlife activities make tourists not interested in traveling domestically. If we look at it, night activities can only be counted on the fingers of one hand, mainly in cities such as Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Nha Trang, Phu Quoc, and Ha Long. Other issues such as price cutting and food hygiene and safety are also reasons hindering domestic tourism.
Meanwhile, Mr. Pham Hai Quynh, Director of the Asian Tourism Development Institute (ATI), commented that 2023 reflects the chaos of domestic tourism when there is a lack of connection between travel businesses and airlines. and the destination itself. Therefore, in the new year, the tourism industry needs close cooperation to ensure the benefits of all participants. That is shown through the establishment of support and assurance mechanisms in the cooperation process, and at the same time creating policies to promote and encourage sustainable cooperation.
The issue of cooperation between the three parties mentioned above is still a difficult problem to solve, Mr. Quynh said. Currently, Mr. Quynh assesses that the parties are still operating separately, airlines cannot borrow strength from travel businesses and vice versa.
Ms. Pham Phuong Anh, General Director of Vietnam Tourism, shared the same opinion and said that in order for domestic tourism products to be competitive, input transportation prices such as planes and cars need to be stable. Stable input prices will help travel businesses have strategies to build early, quality products and appropriate promotional programs to a large number of tourists.
Although there are still many difficulties, a Best Price representative said that many prospects can be seen in the road tour aspect thanks to favorable traffic. In 2023, the Phan Thiet - Dau Giay expressway will come into operation, bringing a quite positive signal for Binh Thuan tourism. Upcoming international sports and music events held in Vietnam will also contribute to boosting the number of domestic visitors and building an image internationally.
Representatives of many businesses predict that foreign tourism products will still dominate in 2024. Ms. Tran Phuong Linh - Marketing Director, Information Technology of BenThanh Tourist, said foreign destinations have attraction from landscape, culture and stability in cost and service quality.
From the fourth quarter of 2023, the company has noticed that Vietnamese tourists tend to prioritize high-end tours, costing from 35 million VND per person, long journeys to distant markets and predicts this will be one of Priorities for tourists in 2024.
Best Price statistics that the proportion of customers booking mid-range - high-priced tours in 2023 will increase significantly compared to 2019. Customers booking tours to Japan in 2023 are 7 times higher than in 2019, similarly, the number of bookings for Korean tours is 7 times higher than in 2019. Nationality increased 4 times; Europe doubled and Taiwan increased 8 times.
This company forecasts that the foreign tourism market will still be vibrant, especially in mid-range - high-end markets such as Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong or Australia. These are markets of customers with a high average income or higher, less affected by the economic recession. Diplomatic activities in 2023 between Vietnam and South Korea and China also promise to have a positive impact on tourism activities.
At the end of 2023, Google released a report on the overall situation of Vietnam, which showed that "the group of people with a high spending level spends on average 5.4 times more than the group of people with a low spending level." than". In terms of tourism, the high spending group spends 4.9 times more than the low spending group.
We see a big shift in customer service on tours, and mid-high-end products are seeing strong growth. This is a customer group that is less affected by the economic recession, Mr. Tu said.
Representatives of Vietnam Tourism shared the same comments about the positive signals of the outbound market, emphasizing that high-spending customers do not care much about price. In addition to great demand from customers, prices for foreign tours will also increase little in the coming year. Regarding mid-range tours, Ms. Phuong Anh said there is a phenomenon of "unfair competition" and "cheap prices but poor quality". Therefore, tourists need to be careful when choosing next year.
In the "Draft Report on the implementation of work tasks in 2023 and implementation of directions and tasks in 2024" announced by the National Tourism Administration on December 29, the tourism industry aims to welcome 17-18 million visitors. international visitors in 2024 after 2023 attracted 12.6 million, equal to 70% of the pre-epidemic number. With this goal, Vietnamese tourism is expected to recover 95-100% compared to 2019.
I think a 30% increase compared to 2023 is enough to reflect the good recovery of Vietnam's tourism industry. Reaching 100% as in 2019 is still difficult in the context of many businesses facing hardship, Mr. Quynh said.
He said agreeing to allow citizens of all countries around the world to apply for e-visa is a "bright spot" in Vietnam's efforts to attract international tourists. However, the problem of long waiting times and the uneven e-visa application process are still challenges that need to be resolved. Therefore, Mr. Quynh expects there to be further innovation in visa policy to attract more tourists.
According to Mr. Dang Manh Phuoc, CEO of The Outboux Company, a tourism market research company in Vietnam, by 2023, Asian visitors will account for more than 50% of the total number of international visitors to Southeast Asia. If China is not included, this number is approximately 40%.
By the end of the third quarter of this year, the Asian market had only recovered about 62%, among the lowest in the world. Meanwhile, the recovery rate of the European market at the same time was 94%. Explaining the decline in European tourists in Asian countries this year and in previous years, Mr. Phuoc said that on an overall scale, global tourists are changing their travel needs, in addition to other factors. other economic objectivity.
Tourists prioritize close trips and intra-regional travel. Therefore, the recovery rate of the European market is good but European visitors to Asia are low, Mr. Phuoc said.
Therefore, Outbox representatives said the Asian market will still be the main driving force of regional tourism, including Vietnam. In 2023 and in the coming years, the individual passenger market share of the Asian market is growing rapidly. This forces travel companies to change the old approach that is popular in Vietnam, which is to only prioritize charter, package, and cheap trips.

The earthquake caused some tours to Japan to be canceled
A number of tours from Hong Kong to Japan were canceled or postponed due to the 7.6-magnitude earthquake causing heavy damage to some areas in Ishikawa, including tourist attractions.
The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) said that from the evening of January 2 to the morning of January 3, Japan suffered 200 more earthquakes, bringing the total number from January 1 to 400. At least 64 people died. , more than 300 people were injured in the 7.6 magnitude earthquake on January 1 in Ishikawa Prefecture. The Noto Peninsula was the hardest hit with hundreds of buildings damaged.
Hong Kong's two largest travel companies said on January 2 that they had canceled tours or changed itineraries. WWPKG said all trips this month to the heavily affected city of Wajima in Ishikawa Prefecture will be canceled to ensure safety. At least 10 tours with a total of 150 guests are affected. EGL Tours company, which has 16 tours with 350 guests scheduled to depart in January, also had to adjust their itinerary.
According to WWPKG, customers can change travel plans, change destinations or reserve money to travel after Japan stabilizes the situation. However, tours to other areas of Ishikawa Prefecture such as Kanazawa City or the hot spring resort Wakura Onsen are continuing.
Faced with the above information, many Korean tourists are also hesitant about their upcoming trip to Japan. Japan is one of the most popular destinations for Korean tourists, so tour cancellations could lead to significant economic losses for the Japanese tourism industry.

However, the Japanese tourism industry said it has not yet witnessed mass tour cancellations. Local companies received many inquiries from foreign partners but did not cancel trips because most of the pre-booked tours were not near Ishikawa prefecture, which suffered the most severe consequences of the earthquake, or the tour booking time was far away, on March-April.

Passenger flights from 2024 to 2023
Passengers on Cathay Pacific flight CX872 departed from Hong Kong at 1:00 a.m. on January 1 and arrived in San Francisco at 8:22 p.m. on December 31, 2023.
Countries around the world do not welcome 2024 at the same time due to time zone differences. Many airlines take advantage of the time zone difference to sell "back in time" flights, taking passengers from the new year back to the old year to celebrate New Year's Eve and New Year twice.
Passengers on flight CX872 of Cathay Pacific Airlines left Hong Kong at just after 1:00 a.m. on January 1 and arrived in San Francisco, USA at 8:22 p.m. on December 31, in time to celebrate New Year's Eve and the New Year again.
The second flight to do this is All Nippon Airways' NH106, departing from Tokyo, Japan, at 12:48 on January 1, landing in Los Angeles, USA, at 5:12 p.m. on December 31.
There are less fortunate passengers who "missed" New Year's Eve for the second time. United Airlines flight UA200 is scheduled to depart from Guam at 7:35 a.m. on January 1, landing in Honolulu, Hawaii, at 6:50 p.m. on December 31, 2023. The company also previously had a promotional campaign with an Instagram post about this time travel flight. "You only live once but you can celebrate New Year's Eve twice. Time travel is real," United Airlines wrote.
Finally, the flight was delayed for 6 hours, leaving Guam at 1:49 p.m. on January 1, landing in Honolulu at 12:34 p.m. on January 1. Passengers expressed disappointment that the airline could not turn their interesting ideas into reality. "Good idea but unfortunately the flight was late. I couldn't celebrate the New Year twice," a passenger complained on the airline's X (Twitter's new name).
I specifically booked this flight to celebrate the New Year twice, another passenger added to express disappointment. Others took solace in the fact that passengers on flight UA200 nonetheless had the chance to turn back time by experiencing the 12:34 moment twice.
Countries around the world determine time based on the International Date Line, an imaginary line that serves as a boundary to determine the start and end of a day. As a rule, countries closer to the left of the date change date start the earliest. Countries located closer to the right welcome the new date later.
The island nation of Kiribati is the place to welcome New Year and the earliest New Year in the world. The two uninhabited islands of Baker and Howland in the US are the latest places to celebrate the New Year, almost a day after Kiribati. Hawaii welcomes the New Year 30 minutes before Baker and Howland, while Hong Kong and Tokyo are among the top destinations to welcome the New Year the earliest.

Linh's first impression when she set foot in this land was that the landscape was covered in white. "There is almost no place without snow, it feels like being lost in a fairy tale world." Linh shared.

Linh's favorite activity is riding a reindeer-pulled sleigh in the pine forest and watching nature at sunset. Linh also bought a tour to visit the reindeer farm, feed the reindeer and take photos with these animals.
Reindeer are animals that cannot be seen everywhere, so Linh was "very excited" to see, interact with and learn about their lives and behaviors. "This is a quite gentle, healing activity and especially suitable for children," Linh said.

In Lapland, I could see the aurora just lying in my room, Linh shared. Linh's room is an igloo greenhouse, modeled after the domed igloo tent built entirely of Eskimo ice and snow in cold regions such as the Arctic or Greenland.
At around 5:00 p.m., while in her room, Linh discovered blue streaks of light appearing in the sky in the newly taken photo. "At that time, I thought this was an effect on glass to make visitors feel like it was a real aurora," Linh said. About 5 minutes later, Linh's igloo tent rang the bell. At that time, she realized that the aurora had appeared and ran out to admire it.

According to the local tour guide, the aurora in Lapland also has many other colors such as yellow, pink, and purple. They often appear on clear and bright days, without clouds or snow.

Tacos shop in Hanoi owned by a French owner
Opening a French tacos restaurant in Hanoi in 2018, Julien Sanchez was one of the first people to bring this type of cake to Vietnam.
French tacos are different from traditional Mexican tacos even though the names are similar. According to The New Yorker, French tacos were invented at the beginning of the 21st century in the Rhône-Alpes region. French tacos use a tortilla shell (a thin, round, flat cake made from flour or cornstarch, originating from Mexico), and the filling is made from meat, vegetables, fries and sauce. This is also the basic ingredient of a Mexican taco, the only difference is that French tacos are tightly rolled while Mexican tacos are like an open-mouth sandwich, without fries.
In appearance, French tacos look more like Mexican burritos. This similarity also causes a lot of controversy, especially with Mexicans who believe there is "cultural appropriation".

Julien Sanchez (pictured) came to Vietnam in 2016 and came up with the idea of ​​selling French tacos after meeting his wife in 2017.
The biggest difficulty at first was introducing customers to what French tacos are because even French people who are not near Lyon sometimes don't know about the existence of this type of cake.
Julien said he tried French tacos for the first time when he was in middle school. Where he lives, tacos are like a type of snack, the ingredients are mainly from industrial goods, cheap, and easy to buy.

Julien named the store Hey Pelo with the first location in Tay Ho district. The word "pelo" in Lyon slang means "friend".
Initially, his target audience was foreigners. However, after only a short time, the store quickly attracted Vietnamese customers. From a store with only Julien and his wife in the kitchen, they have developed two more branches with 15 employees each.
In the photo is the store in Ba Dinh. At lunchtime, the store has hundreds of orders - mainly for takeout or delivery. Many customers coming to the restaurant have to wait for a long time. In the evening, customers filled two floors of the restaurant.

The store's cakes come in 5 sizes, from XS to L, with prices ranging from 75,000-350,000 VND each. According to Julien, the largest one is about the size of a bicep and weighs about 1 kg. For young people with average appetite, a portion size S is reasonable, with a price of about 130,000 VND (including side dishes).
Each cake is personalized from choosing the size to the filling ingredients. With vegetables, customers have four options such as onions, tomatoes, lettuce or cooked vegetable salad. The store also has 6 options including beef, chicken and vegetarian dishes.

After choosing, the staff will put the ingredients into a tortilla shell and then put it in the oven. Each cake takes about 15-20 minutes to complete, including baking time.
Julien said that in France the cake was created in a suburb with many immigrants, so it was mainly aimed at workers who needed to eat quickly and be full. However, Julien realized that in Vietnam, fresh and clean ingredients are abundant. Vegetables are imported from our own suppliers, always guaranteed to be fresh. The tortilla shells are also made in a separate facility and the sauces are handmade.
Besides ensuring quality, this is also a way to support the local economy, Julien said.

Julien rolled the cake tightly before putting it in the oven. He said initially, there were only four wheel sizes including S, M, L and XL. However, when the number of Vietnamese customers increased, many people complained that size S was still too big for one person to eat. Therefore, Julien decided to make more size XS and agreed to cut the cake in half from size S. Julien said cake cutting only appeared in Vietnam.

Vietnamese tourists feel 'like sitting in a hammock' during the earthquake in Japan
Some Vietnamese tourists said they encountered an earthquake while riding in the car to the ancient village of Shirakawago and felt "swaying like they were sitting in a hammock".
On January 1, Japan suffered 155 earthquakes nationwide, of which the strongest was a 7.6 magnitude earthquake in Ishikawa province. The epicenter in the Noto Peninsula affected five prefectures in the region: Ishikawa, Niigata, Fukui, Toyama and Gifu, according to Reuters. The Meteorological Agency said the earthquake caused great damage with nearly 50,000 households losing power and tens of thousands of houses damaged. At least 20 people died.
At the time of the earthquake, there were about 20 Vietnamese tourists visiting the ancient village of Shirakawago, Gifu province. Shirakawago, about 350 km from Tokyo, is one of the oldest villages in the country and was recognized as a world cultural heritage by UNESCO in 1995.
A Vietnamese tour guide said Vietnamese tourists were a little "nervous" but "not too scared" when encountering an earthquake. Everyone is sitting in the car, feeling "swaying like a hammock".
Mr. Nhan Phuong, southern regional coordinator of the Japan Tourism Promotion Agency (JNTO) in Vietnam, said that Vietnamese tourist groups traveling during the New Year are still safe and there is no panic.
Many people were surprised and a little worried when suddenly the ground shook strongly and the bus floated as if on water, Mr. Phuong said.
To date, there has been no loss of life or property to the Vietnamese delegations. However, some tourist groups were forced to change their schedules and routes because part of the highway was temporarily closed after the earthquake. During an emergency press conference yesterday, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hayashi Yoshimasa said some sections of five highways were closed as a damage prevention measure, according to Skift.
Mr. Phuong further informed that the hotel lobby of a group of Vietnamese tourists staying in Niigata province was flooded due to large waves crashing in after the earthquake, making the elevator unusable. Guests must take the stairs to check in. Tour programs in the Hokuriku area (including 4 prefectures Ishikawa, Fukui, Niigata and Toyama) were mostly canceled this time due to highway damage and closed services.
According to Ms. Huynh Phan Phuong Hoang, Deputy General Director of Vietravel Tourism Company, December is not the peak season for traveling to Japan for Vietnamese tourists. Her company has more than 500 customers traveling to different cities in Japan and are all far away from strong earthquake areas so they are not affected. "The groups have now finished their tour program and are preparing to return to Vietnam," Ms. Hoang said.
With more than 20 years of experience serving Vietnamese customers in the Japanese market, Ms. Hoang said that Japan often has earthquakes, so the government and people always have plans and timely preparations to adapt. Vietnamese travel companies are "familiar" with the earthquake situation in Japan, so people have a calm attitude and are not too worried.
Mr. Nguyen Van Dung, Director of Asia Gate Travel, a unit with 10 years of experience in the Japanese tour market in Hanoi, said earthquakes cannot be predicted like the weather. When an earthquake occurs, a text message will be sent to your phone in Japan about 10 seconds in advance. "Japan has an average of more than 1,000 earthquakes every year. The places where strong shaking occurred this time did not have many Vietnamese visitors, so most of them were safe," Mr. Dung said.
For tourists from Vietnam to Japan, Mr. Phuong recommends "thoroughly complying with government instructions", especially instructions from the Meteorological and Disaster Prevention Agency in Japan. Besides, visitors also need to listen to instructions from local guides, companies providing travel and logistics services; Quickly find a safe hiding place, away from high-rise buildings and public buildings, and large trees that are likely to fall. Visitors should not use the elevator and charge their phones regularly for convenient communication.

The series of tremors occurred on New Year's Day, a time when millions of Japanese visit temples and pagodas to pray for good luck. Ishikawa Prefectural Police Department announced that at least 8 people were killed. Local officials also recorded many injuries and collapsed houses in five prefectures including Ishikawa, Niigata, Fukui, Toyama and Gifu.
A person who was praying for good luck at Keta Shrine in Hakui, Kanazawa City, a famous tourist destination in Ishikawa, said the scene was "very scary" as the temple continuously shook. The temple gate collapsed, and people gathered around with worried faces.
Shirakawago Ancient Village, a famous tourist destination in Gifu Prefecture, is also one of the 5 central provinces affected by the earthquake, luckily it was barely affected.
According to experts, the impact of the earthquake could be very widespread on transportation and communication. The Japanese Royal Family canceled the New Year's celebration at the Tokyo Imperial Palace due to the Ishikawa earthquake.
Coastal areas in Niigata, Toyama and Ishikawa are on high alert and residents are encouraged to evacuate promptly. The Japanese government emphasizes the importance of moving to higher ground and away from the coast as much as possible to avoid risks if there is a tsunami.

For unrated homestays and accommodation establishments, capacity is estimated at 70%. More than 155,000 visitors have come to the province, of which mainly domestic visitors are 135,000.
Mr. Tran Son Binh, Deputy Director of Lao Cai Department of Tourism, said tourism activities in the province during the New Year period took place safely, without solicitation, increased service prices, speculation or profiteering. .
Ha Giang welcomed 89,000 visitors, 70% of whom visited sites in the Dong Van Karst Plateau Geopark. The large number of tourists causes local overload on many routes leading to main tourist destinations, and mountain passes are often clogged for 20-30 minutes. A representative of the Department of Culture, Sports and Tourism of Ha Giang province said there were no incidents regarding traffic or prices or service quality recorded during the holiday period.
Hanoi recorded a trend of people traveling locally because the vacation time was quite short, with about 402,000 visitors. The number of international visitors is estimated at 72,000 - doubling the same period.
The information and tourist support department of the Department of Tourism provided information to 30 visitors about tourist destinations in the area and did not receive information related to tourism environment, security and safety. for guests.
According to records from many travel agencies, few tourists choose beach tourism in the northern region due to the cold weather. However, most 5-star cruise ships on Ha Long Bay (Quang Ninh) and Lan Ha (Hai Phong) recorded "sold out" before Tet because of high demand for relaxation, mostly from foreign guests.
In the central region, international visitors account for the majority. The total number of visitors and tourists traveling to Da Nang during Christmas and New Year 2024 (December 23, 2023 - January 1) is estimated to reach about 261,000, an increase of 34.7% over the same period in 2023 and international visitors. accounts for more than half. Domestic visitors are mainly from Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and neighboring provinces such as Quang Nam, Thua Thien Hue, and Quang Ngai. International visitors are mainly from Korea, Taiwan, Japan, India, and Southeast Asia (Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines).
4-5 star and equivalent tourist accommodation establishments have an estimated capacity of 60% (up 15-20% over the same period last year), guests mainly stay in hotels and coastal resorts.
In Quang Nam, the weather conditions during the New Year days were not favorable, but the number of visitors and stays still increased compared to the previous year, especially international visitors. The total number of visitors and stays is estimated at 103,000, an increase of 130%, including about 91,000 international visitors, an increase of 169%.
Phu Quoc and Kien Giang also recorded positive signals from foreign visitors, although domestic visitors were "not many". The total number of visitors to Kien Giang reached more than 120,000, the average room occupancy rate was over 63% - the same period last year was about 45-50%.
Mr. Bui Quoc Thai, Director of Kien Giang Department of Tourism, assessed that tourism activities took place safely and security and order were guaranteed. The hotline of the provincial and local tourism industry does not record feedback on the quality and price of tourism services.
Craig Holowell, an Australian tourist, chose Phu Quoc to welcome the new year. He commented that the city owns many impressive resorts and is filled with a year-end festive atmosphere. Australian tourists love to relax in the swimming pool and soak in the "crystal clear" water in Phu Quoc. Taking the cable car across the sea to Hon Thom is also an interesting thing Holowell wants to tell his friends in Australia.
This will be an unforgettable time for me and my wife, he said.
Like Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City also recorded that city residents mainly choose to travel within the city or go to nearby eco-tourism areas due to short vacation time and high airfares. About 1.6 million visitors at tourist, entertainment and entertainment destinations, an increase of 3.1% over the same period in 2023. Visitors staying in the area during the three-day holiday reached about 225,000, an increase of 5 % over the same period; Room occupancy is estimated at 87%; Tourism revenue is about 6,400 billion VND.
Reports from travel businesses in the area show a high increase in foreign tourists coming to the city, especially cruise passengers - a stream of high-end tourists from Europe, America, Australia and Japan.
This year, Ho Chi Minh City organized a two-point fireworks display, attracting great attention from domestic and foreign visitors. Jo Dey, an American tourist who came to Ho Chi Minh City to celebrate the New Year with his family, said he enjoyed the festive atmosphere in the city. On New Year's Eve, she and everyone experienced a motorbike tour to explore the city's cuisine and commented "extremely interesting". On the way back to the hotel, the female tourist witnessed the streets of Ho Chi Minh City packed with people watching fireworks.
Some people in the group were stuck for more than 30 minutes and returned to the hotel later than expected. However, we feel safe and enjoy the atmosphere, she said.
Other tourist destinations such as Da Lat, Binh Thuan, Khanh Hoa, and Vung Tau (Ba Ria - Vung Tau) all recorded high room occupancy rates from 60%-85%. In Binh Thuan, tourists concentrate in Ham Tien, Mui Ne, and Tien Thanh areas. In Khanh Hoa, guests also stay at resorts in Bai Dai, Doc Let and self-contained resorts on the island.
However, as recorded by VnExpress on December 31, the weather was gloomy in the afternoon, the beach on Tran Phu street, Nha Trang city, had a few local people coming to swim. Nha Trang Tourist Pier, belonging to the Nha Trang Bay Management Board, is also quite deserted. Other tourist attractions such as the Institute of Oceanography and Ponagar Tower have few visitors. The area of ​​Back Beach, Vung Tau, is also not as crowded as during the summer. People renting chairs and floats on the beach say the number of rentals has decreased.
Regarding this issue, Mr. Ong Trinh Hang, Director of the Department of Tourism of Ba Ria - Vung Tau province, said that Back Beach has big waves so tourists are distributed in other areas, especially Front Beach. Resorts and small hotels are now also investing in swimming pools at their establishments. Therefore, the fact that Back Beach is empty does not reflect the reality of Vung Tau tourism during the holidays.
As noted by VnExpress, the way to calculate the number of visitors in each locality is not uniform. Some provinces and cities only count staying guests, but others count them by "turn" - that is, a visitor who goes to 5 local attractions will count 5 times. Inconsistency in statistics can cause the tourism industry to make inaccurate forecasts.

New Year in the world's earliest place to welcome 2024
Kiribati, the island nation entering 2024 the earliest in the world, has a tradition of gathering to party, eating crayfish, and drinking coconut nectar to welcome the new year.
Most residents and tourists will gather on Kiritimati (Christmas Island), Kiribati's largest island, to party and watch fireworks to celebrate New Year's Eve and the New Year. Parties often take place in private homes, bars, hotels or maneaba, community houses of Christians and locals, scattered across the island.
During the New Year event, Kiribati people eat grilled pork, crayfish and other traditional dishes such as taro, banana, coconut and coconut nectar mixed with water, tea or wine.
Such large festive events are called Te Botaki or traditional gatherings. In addition to New Year, people also often gather to celebrate birthdays, weddings and funerals. The term "te botaki" emphasizes the community element of these events, where people are encouraged to participate and contribute in a variety of ways. Te Botaki events play an important role in preserving and passing on Kiribati's cultural heritage from generation to generation.
Kiritimati Island is located south of Hawaii Island, USA, but these two islands become the first and almost last places in the world to celebrate the New Year because they are located on both sides of the international date line.
Kiritimati Island is located closest to the left of the date change line, so it becomes the earliest inhabited place to welcome the new day. Hawaii is located closest to the right, so it becomes the latest place to welcome the new day, 30 minutes before Baker and Howland islands.
It was not until 1995 that Kiribati island became the country to celebrate the earliest New Year in the world. Previously, the Kiribati government allowed three time zones to exist on either side of the date line. Therefore, the country will have two days of coexistence, making trade difficult. From January 1, 1995, the government decided to use the same time zone. This move is considered a right change in attracting tourists because since then, many people have flown to this place to celebrate the New Year earlier than the rest of the world.
In 2000, the island nation's tourism industry was bumper with tourists because many people flocked here to welcome the first dawn of the 3rd millennium. Today, Kiribati is famous for its pristine islands, coral reefs and white sand beaches.

Saigon youth wear ao dai to have fun at the beginning of the new year
Many young people in Saigon flocked to famous tourist destinations in the central area of ​​District 1 to take photos and have fun in the early morning of the new year 2024.
The area in front of the City Post Office is also bustling. This place not only attracts a large number of tourists to learn about Vietnamese culture, but also young Saigon people who come to take photos and have cultural entertainment on holidays or weekends.

Many Vietnamese tourists choose to celebrate the New Year abroad
Wishing to have more "first in their lives" experiences, many Vietnamese tourists go abroad to celebrate New Year, and the number of foreign tours increases.
Satisfying, sparkling, worthy of 13 hours of waiting were the feelings of Ms. Dung Pham in Hanoi after directly watching the fireworks display to welcome the new year 2024 on the Sydney Harbor Bridge, Australia. She and her husband and their friends chose a place and waited here from 11am with thousands of Australians and tourists to witness a special moment at this famous place.
Ms. Dung went to Australia in mid-December to visit relatives, combine travel and celebrate the New Year abroad for the first time. Knowing that the Sydney Harbor Bridge is one of the most impressive New Year's Eve destinations in the world, she and her husband arranged the most reasonable travel itinerary to be here on December 31.
This first experience is very valuable, helping me relax mentally and gain more motivation for the new year, Ms. Dung said.
Ms. Trinh Hang in Hai Phong also decided to celebrate the most important moment of the New Year abroad for the first time because "she wanted to enjoy the festive atmosphere in Europe, especially Christmas and New Year's Eve". Ms. Hang said this is also the biggest discount season of the year with many new products and collections from big brands. Everywhere is decorated splendidly and beautifully.
At the end of December 2023, Ms. Hang decided to leave and booked an 11-day, 10-night tour through three countries: France - Switzerland - Italy, of which on the night of December 31, she was in Venice - one of the most romantic New Year's Eve destinations. world and "not as crowded as other big cities".
Knowing that choosing a tour in the new year will increase costs, with both air tickets and hotel rooms being 20-30% higher, but Ms. Hang accepted it for a "first in her life" experience. According to Ms. Hang, in winter the days are short and the nights are long, so taking a tour will be reasonable and save time traveling between attractions.
Choosing to travel abroad for New Year's Eve is an experience that helps visitors understand more about culture, especially in countries that do not have Lunar New Year. On this occasion, especially in places where there are fireworks displays and countdown ceremonies, visitors also have the opportunity to witness the organization, security and order and many things that tourism at other times of the year does not have. Most Vietnamese tourists celebrating the New Year abroad appreciate the order and discipline in the organization of their country.
The appointment took more than 13 hours, but Ms. Dung and her friends had nothing to complain about. They were allowed to bring food and drink, but police checked their bags when entering fireworks viewing spots. Most people are aware and sit in the designated areas. Occasionally the police have to warn violators. The fireworks viewing area has enough restrooms, food carts, free drinks, and the surrounding areas are neat and clean.
They are also very thoughtful when organizing a small fireworks display, called Family Fireworks, at 9:00 p.m. for families with young children who have to go to bed early, Ms. Dung said.
Mr. Pham Van Chinh and his wife in Hanoi were also present at the moment of welcoming the new year 2024 in Shanghai city, China and were "impressed" with the traffic coordination and security in the central area.
They sent the army to control traffic on the streets along the center, along with the police. The people are very large but compliant, Mr. Chinh said.
Shanghai does not have a countdown festival, people mainly gather in the area along the Huangpu River to go out to eat, drink and shop. "The crowd must be dozens of times larger than Hoan Kiem Lake. They are crowded but orderly, not crowded and comply with all regulations, the surroundings are clean, no car horns," Mr. Chinh said.
Many years ago, Vietnamese people often considered New Year as a "Western" Tet, but now many Western features have been deeply integrated into Vietnamese life. Organizing countdown festivals and music parties to celebrate the new year or going out during times of transition is proof of that.
Marketing Director of Best Price Travel Company Bui Thanh Tu said that this New Year they have 70 groups registering for foreign tours, from both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Most tourists are young people and family groups, choosing destinations mainly in Asia.
Tour prices increase on average 1.2 to 1.5 times compared to normal days, but the number of tour bookings is still much higher than in 2022 when foreign tourism is just starting to return, even higher than before Covid 2019. 2019. The itinerary is also diverse, including both air and road routes, Mr. Tu said.
Similarly, a representative of Vietnam Tourism said that there are more than 50 groups "going abroad" to celebrate New Year, the most popular destinations are Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Japan, respectively, accounting for 90% of tours. travel this time. Domestic tours are only about 10%, mainly family groups going to Phan Thiet and Phu Quoc, without MICE groups.

Spent more than a billion VND traveling around the world in 6 months
Even though they spent all their savings in 6 years, the trip to nearly 20 countries helped Vinh and his wife have special memories with their young daughter and helped her learn a third language.
Spending more than a billion VND to take his small family to travel to nearly 20 countries around the world was a "rather reckless" decision by Mr. Dang Duc Vinh, a photographer living in France. He and his wife took unpaid leave for 6 months and spent most of their savings in 6 years.
Money can be earned back, but the time and opportunity to have such a special experience with your child will almost never come again, Mr. Vinh said. Mr. Vinh's daughter, Dang Chlóe, is over two years old, preparing to enter the learning environment and does not have long vacations to travel far away.
To prepare for the trip, since March, Mr. Vinh's family has applied for visas at the same time for the UK, USA, Canada, Japan, and Korea. According to the plan, after each road trip, the family returned to Paris, France, rested for a few days to gain strength, and changed clothes accordingly, so their luggage was quite light.
The trip departs on April 23 and ends on October 31. On the first day of the journey, when flying from France to Japan, problems with the time zone difference occurred. It took his family about 4 or 5 days to adapt and return to their normal routine.
During 15 days in Japan (April 23 - May 7), his family used public transportation to travel through 9 major cities, typically Osaka, Hiroshima, Kyoto, and Tokyo. "Japan is completely different from the rest of the countries in the world with the perfect harmony between ancient architecture and culture with modern, comfortable living," Mr. Vinh said.
They arrived in Yamanashi province, central Japan, at the end of April, just in time for the Fuji Shibazakura festival, when fields of pink, white, and purple cherry blossoms bloom at the foot of Mount Fuji. The color contrast between the blue sky, the snow-capped peak of Mount Fuji all year round and the brilliant flower beds create a "poetic" picture of nature.
During the 15 days in Korea (May 8 - 22), his family spent on average three days exploring each city including Seoul, Jeju, Daegu, Gyeongju, Busan. Not the ancient architecture in the ancient capital Gyeongju or the modernity in the capital Seoul, but Jeju Island is the place Mr. Vinh loves the most because of its "familiar feeling". There are no long white sand beaches or straight rows of coconut trees, Jeju is mainly black rock beaches and small fishing villages located along the coast. "The scene is identical to the Korean reality show Family Outing that I saw in the years before 2010," Mr. Vinh shared.
Due to subjectively not exchanging much cash into won (Korean currency), his family encountered a few "half laughing and half crying" situations. When you lack cash to buy entrance tickets at the ancient village of Andong Hahoe or pay fees at the toll booth on the highway, the staff are sympathetic and let you pass for free or pay out of your own pocket. One time he got lost in Gyeongju and arrived at the homestay late at night, but the host couple still waited and prepared dinner for his family. "Korea is the country where I received the most enthusiastic help," he said.
After Korea, there are road trips from 11 to 27 days in 4 months in European countries in order: Spain 12 days (May 25 - June 5); France - Corsica - Italy 23 days (June 8 - 30); France 11 days (July 3 - 13); England - Scotland 27 days (July 17 - August 12); Germany - Austria - Slovenia - Croatia - Italy 26 days (August 16 - September 12). The journey ends with two 15-day road trips in Canada (September 15 - 30) and a 26-day trip along the West Coast of the United States (October 5 - 31).
Every road trip brings his family "majestic, beautiful, unique, and strange natural pictures", especially the West Coast of the United States. Arches National Park is famous for its more than 2,000 natural sandstone domes, dating back 65 million years ago. The Grand Canyon, with hundreds of canyons two kilometers deep, is considered the largest abyss on earth dyed red, orange, and yellow. The entire landscape in Monument Valley is covered with a yellow-orange color caused by weathered iron oxide on the outside.
During the trip, little Chloe showed interest in new natural scenery or cultural changes such as people's costumes and architectural works at each destination. A small incident occurred during the last week in the US when the baby had a mild fever. However, the condition was not serious and the journey was almost over, so she had a lot of time to rest immediately afterward.
The cost of the trip was about 40,000 euros (about one billion VND). Of which, hotel costs account for about 40% (about 400 million VND) and travel costs (airfare, train tickets, gasoline) account for about 35% (350 million VND). The remaining are food costs and other small expenses.
Spending a large amount of money on the trip, Mr. Vinh thinks that what he gets in return is completely worth it. For little Chloe, because she traveled for 6 months at the right time to form language (2 - 6 years old), she can now speak English, in addition to Vietnamese and French. As for Mr. Vinh and his wife, the biggest change after the trip was the decision to quit working in the office and switch to freelance work to have more time to spend with family.
My husband and I have learned to live more simply and appreciate every moment and every little thing in life, he said.
According to Mr. Vinh, it is quite difficult to give advice to other families because each person's situation is different. He advises tourists to learn about entry, transportation, weather conditions and prepare clothes and tools to bring. For long trips, tourists rent self-driving cars to save money and be more proactive than traveling by public transportation.
Having read an article that said "every action your child does with us now could be the last", Mr. Vinh and his wife always try to create and preserve as many memories as possible with their daughter. . "Many people may think that we are reckless and careless when spending a large amount of money to travel. But my husband and I think that each person only has the chance to live once and in that life, there are priceless things that Money can't buy it, it's experiences and memories," he said.

What do people from different countries eat to welcome the new year?
Germans eat lucky pigs, Spaniards eat 12 grapes, and Japanese people eat soba noodles to welcome the new year.
People from different countries will eat different dishes on the first day of the new year, but they all have the same purpose: to bring luck and prosperity.
Below are famous traditional dishes in the world compiled and introduced by CNN.

The world's largest salt mine over 700 years old
Poland
In two hours visiting the system of chapels, salt lakes, and museums located in the Wieliczka salt mine, visitors can only explore 2% of the area of ​​this oldest salt mine in Poland.
Wieliczka salt mine is located in southern Poland, about 16 km from the ancient city of Krakow. Wieliczka is one of the oldest salt mines and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The mine was exploited from the 13th century until 1996 and became the largest source of salt in Poland for many years before becoming a tourist destination. Over more than 700 years, 26 wells have been drilled, creating about 9 million m3 of space in the Wieliczka mine, with the deepest point reaching 327 m.
The hollow caves left after the mining process have been repaired over the years to turn into a "new world" where visitors can explore on foot at a depth of 137 m.

According to the description on Lonely Planet, it is a maze of corridors, tunnels, galleries, and restaurants spanning 245 km distributed over 9 floors. However, the salt mine is only open to tourists within three floors with a maximum depth of 137 m via 2-hour guided tours. The entrance ticket price for an adult is about more than 700,000 VND.

On the salt walls on both sides of the chapel hall are bas-reliefs depicting biblical events such as the wedding in Canada or the escape to Egypt.

Leaving the gallery, visitors can choose a miner's route tour or a salt lake sightseeing tour. If you choose the miner's route, visitors will move through tunnels with walls with crystallized salt crystals on the ceiling and sides. These tunnels are ancient salt transport routes, designed to ensure ventilation so the deeper you go, the colder it gets.

About 20 million years ago, the Wieliczka area with its natural caves was still under the sea. Due to the tectonic activity of the earth's crust, this area gradually rose and became land. During that process, seawater accumulates in caves and underground rocks, and over time, forms salt mines.

Nha Trang and Vung Tau beaches are empty during New Year

Other tourist attractions such as the Institute of Oceanography and Ponagar Tower also have few visitors. Many people said that during the winter, local people want to move to Da Lat, Lam Dong province, to travel, so Nha Trang is more deserted during the summer tourist season.
According to Cam Ranh International Airport, it is expected that during the New Year, the port will serve about 313 flights taking off and landing with about 51,000 passengers. Of these, there were 169 international flights with about 31,000 passengers; 144 domestic trips with nearly 20,000 passengers.

In Vung Tau, tourists have fun and swim during New Year on beaches that are not too crowded, despite the sunny weather and light winds. On Bai Sau Beach, nearly 10 km long, there are only many people after 4:00 p.m. at the section of Bai Sau Flagpole to the headquarters of the Tourist Management and Support Center.

People who rent umbrellas, chairs and swimming floats on the beach say the number of customers using their services has dropped sharply.
Due to economic difficulties, people rarely sit on chairs or only rent a chair for 50,000 VND for personal belongings and furniture, one person said.

The Celebrity Solstice ship (Malta nationality) has docked at Ha Long International Cruise Port 5 times in 2023, carrying more than 3,000 European and American tourists. This is also one of the largest tourist groups from October 2023 to present.
However, the number of domestic tourists is quite sparse because people choose to go home to rest with relatives or go to China for short-term vacations through border gates. On December 30 and 31, at Mong Cai international border gate, thousands of people checked in and out.
Locations in the northern mountainous regions such as Lao Cai and Ha Giang are as crowded as expected, because they are close to Hanoi and are in the beautiful season. The occupancy rate of hotels and homestays is estimated at more than 90%. Today, many tourists have to queue for 2-3 hours at the cable car to reach Fansipan peak in Sa Pa.

Group travel to Vietnam is in the world trend of 2024
The pandemic is over, the group travel trend is gradually returning and Vietnam can be one of the destinations that attracts the attention of world tourists.
Black Tomato, a travel company headquartered in London (UK) and New York (USA), has made a forecast of tourism trends in 2024 based on information collected from customers. Below are 5 types of travel that could become a trend next year.
Group travel
After the pandemic, gathering friends and family to travel has become popular. Black Tomato data shows that 30% of customers are groups of 8 or more people. Popular trips include a safari in Botswana, a country in Africa, a cruise down the Nile on a classic Egyptian boat, or an all-inclusive cruise in Vietnam.
New frontier
Tourists increasingly want to escape their comfort zone in terms of both tourist destinations and how to travel. This makes trips to Botswana by car and walking on the sacred path of Kumano Kodo - a famous pilgrimage route for thousands of years in Kansai (Japan), becoming popular.
Multi-generational trips
Family members with common passions can accompany each other and discover new things together. It could be a trip to explore New England cuisine in the US, research about limestone sculpture in Puglia (Italy) or learn about bushido (bushido) in Japanese dojos.
Seek quiet
People living in noisy cities or working stressful jobs are looking for a trip to literally rest and calm down. This means trips in 2024 could be aimed at "ultra-quiet" destinations, such as the less visited areas of Iceland, the shipwreck beaches of the Sketeton Coast (Namibia) or Mongolia.
Tourism is associated with cuisine
Over the past few years, culinary tourism has become a trend, but in 2024, tourists will not only be looking for famous restaurants. Instead, they go into detail to better understand a specific dish or ingredient.
Black Tomato suggests a trip to a family restaurant in a small Peruvian town and a scrumptious ceviche (fish marinated in fresh lemon); through Sicily (Italy) to taste the best honey and see the process of making burrata; Visit cheese caves in France. These trips will help visitors gain a true understanding of the culture that created the famous dishes.

Countries that celebrate New Year 2024 the earliest and latest in the world
Christmas Island in the Republic of Kiribati is the place to welcome the New Year 2024 the earliest in the world, the two islands of Baker and Howland in the US are the latest to welcome the new year.
When the clock chimes to signal midnight on December 31, the world will welcome the new year, but not every country will welcome the new year at the same time. Countries around the world will rely on their own time zones to determine the time entering 2024. All time zones on Earth are relative to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is the time at the meridian zero passes through the Royal Greenwich Observatory, London, England.
These factors help explain why some countries will welcome the new year 2024 first and others will welcome the new year last.
The Republic of Kiribati, an island nation located in the Pacific Ocean, is the first country to welcome the new year 2024 because it is closest to the international date line (to the left). The island nation has an area of ​​more than 3.5 million square kilometers spread over more than 30 coral islands. The main island of Kiritimati (Christmas Island) is considered the earliest place to welcome the New Year in the world, at 5:00 p.m. on December 31 (Hanoi time).
On the map, Kiritimati is located on the same meridian with the Hawaiian Islands, USA, but because it is on the other side of the date line, it welcomes the new year one day earlier. In 2000, the island's tourism industry began to develop as world tourists flocked to this place to "welcome the first dawn of the third millennium". Kiribati is famous for its pristine islands, vast coral reefs, and white sand beaches with clear water.
The next country to celebrate the New Year is New Zealand. At 5:15 p.m. on December 31, the Chatham Islands entered the new year. At 6:00 p.m. on the same day, the remaining cities in this country such as Auckland and Wellington started displaying fireworks to celebrate New Year's Eve. Due to convenient travel, New Zealand has become an ideal tourist destination for tourists who want to welcome the New Year early around the world.
Before the epidemic, New Zealand organized grand countdown programs with many activities to attract tourists. At the beginning of the new year, people and tourists gather at Auckland Harbor Bridge or Sky Tower to watch fireworks to celebrate the New Year.
The next countries entering the new year are Fiji, Australia, Japan, and South Korea. One hour after the Philippines, Singapore, and China welcomed the new year, Vietnam began to enter the transition period between the two years. People in Thailand and Laos will welcome the new year at the same time as Vietnam. People in Myanmar and other South Asian and West Asian countries will welcome the new year 30 minutes to 3 hours after Vietnam. Then there are European and American countries.
The last country to celebrate the New Year is America. The country's uninhabited territories such as Baker Island and Howland will be the last places to end the day along the international date line. Therefore, these two places enter the new year the latest. 30 minutes earlier, Hawaii and other islands in French Polynesia and Alaska welcomed the new year.
Besides, some countries only have one time zone, but some countries have time zone differences like Russia due to its large area. Therefore, some small regions in Russia have entered the new year, but it is only a few hours later in the capital Moscow that the clock strikes 12, signaling midnight.

Looking from a height on the plane, foreign tourists see dragon fruit gardens lit up at night with colorful shapes standing out on a black background.
Brad Stewart account posted a video looking from the plane window during a night flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Australia in September, attracting more than 14 million views on the Tik Tok platform. The video recorded scenes of multicolored shapes glowing in the night, which Brad Stewart described as "not knowing what they were" and asked the online community to answer.
In response to the male tourist's question, there were nearly 7,000 explanatory comments from netizens. Similar to Brad Stewart, many foreigners also wonder about this strange scene. Some people think it's confetti. Account Jebediah Spoonbill commented that it was a bowling mat. Some people couldn't guess exactly what the object was, but from a height above the plane, it looked like multicolored sticky notes.
The video also attracted many Vietnamese people to interact. Accounts from Vietnam all confirm that the strange sight is dragon fruit fields lit up at night. The location where the plane passed by may be in Binh Thuan province. Brad Stewart expressed his surprise and thanked him after having his questions answered.
Going through the areas of Ham Thuan Bac, Ham Thuan Nam or Bac Binh districts, visitors can encounter stretching dragon fruit gardens. Some dragon fruit gardens such as Ham My commune garden, Ham Thuan Nam district are also open for tourists to visit and experience. Dragon fruit garden in Ham My commune is about 30 km from Mui Ne, Phan Thiet city.
Mr. Phan Van Tan, Deputy Director of Binh Thuan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said the whole province grows about 27,000 hectares of dragon fruit, yielding over 500,000 tons per year. Cultivated naturally, dragon fruit only produces fruit during the rainy season from May to October. To produce fruit in the off-season, garden owners must turn on electric lights in the garden. A dragon fruit garden can light 2-3 generations per year. At night, the gardens light up, and from a height on the plane, you can see colorful shapes like in the video posted by Brad Stewart's account.
The technique of using lights to stimulate dragon fruits to produce fruit in the off-season has been applied by Binh Thuan farmers since around the 1990s. At that time, a farmer in Ham Thuan Bac district accidentally installed a light bulb to warm the ducks in the garden and suddenly discovered the The dragon fruit pillar next to it produces flowers. Since then, local growers have begun to apply the lighting technique to off-season production, producing fruit all year round. After traditional incandescent lights, farmers switched to compact lights and now LED lights that consume more energy.
Dragon fruit was also a keyword that created waves in the online community last year when a food company launched dragon fruit instant noodles. The lyrics "first time dragon fruit is in instant noodles" to advertise this product appeared on videos on many social networking platforms, attracting millions of views.

From December 27 to December 30, every day the company has an average of 2-3 delegations to China through Lao Cai border gate. In normal times, the company has about 3 delegations every week.
Currently, Vietnamese tourist groups take about 5 hours to go to China through Lao Cai border gate. On the morning of December 30, the slowest group took about 7 hours to complete the procedures. On weekdays, the waiting time from arriving at Lao Cai border gate until leaving Ha Khau border gate is only about 2 hours.
At Mong Cai border gate, Quang Ninh, the situation is similar. Before the opening of the border gate (7am Vietnam time and 8am China time), it is estimated that thousands of people from both Mong Cai and Dong Hung were crowded at the border gate waiting to complete immigration procedures.
Ms. Pham Thi Oanh, School of Culture and Information of Mong Cai City, said that the number of people from Vietnam to China is larger, mainly groups of people following tour groups. Authorities had to divide lanes to reduce waiting times and erect additional shelters to serve people when it rained a little. It is forecasted that tomorrow the number of visitors to China will also be large.
With a cost of about 4 million VND and the experience of traveling abroad, Chinese road tours are increasingly attracting Vietnamese tourists.
According to the reporter, Chau Hong Ha tour prices during the New Year period have increased by about 20-25% compared to normal. Besides the Chau Hong Ha tour, another popular tour through Lao Cai border gate is Kunming but there is no price increase on this occasion.
Ms. Hoang Tuyet said that the Chau Hong Ha tour on weekdays is subsidized by shopping destinations. On holidays, shopping efficiency is not high, so a surcharge is needed to cover costs. Kunming tours are not much affected by shopping destinations and are being stimulated, so prices are stable.

Chinese guests were investigated for videos defaming Thailand
An influential online tourist in China faced fines and was deported, even banned from entering Thailand because of a video criticizing Bangkok's red light district.
A video criticizing the red light district posted online by female tourist Trung Wang Ziyu quickly attracted the attention of the Immigration Department and the Royal Police. Wang and his accompanying friends were invited to the local police station for questioning and investigation for "discrediting and discrediting the image of Thailand" at the end of December.
Wang is known as a Kol (online influencer) with more than 3 million followers. She arrived in Bangkok on a tourist visa on November 2 and posted several videos sharing her trip experiences. On December 5, she shared a video of her wandering around the red light district of Nana (Nana Plaza), talking about the nightlife here and commenting that "99% of visitors to this place look unkempt", the neighborhood is a place that "doesn't work". safe", urging women not to come here alone.
Wang's video quickly sparked controversy and backlash online, drawing the attention of authorities and forcing her to delete the video and issue a public apology in English, Thai and Chinese.
I understand that my words could have a negative impact and regret it very much. Wang wrote on Facebook and at the same time apologized to the red light district and the people of Thailand. The female tourist also pledged to "use social networks responsibly and delicately" in the future.
Despite Wang's apology, Thai police investigated and took legal action against the female tourist. Maj. Gen. Phanthana Nutchanart, a representative of the Immigration Department, said Wang was found to be working in Thailand without a permit, violating visa policy. Wang could be fined up to 10,000 ($1,400), deported from Thailand and even blacklisted from entering the country in the future.
Some people defended Wang for "only telling the truth, not doing anything wrong". However, others believe that speaking ill of a country you visit is disrespectful to the people and "deserves to be blacklisted".
Nana Plaza is one of three famous red light districts in Bangkok, located in Sukhumvit Soi 4, always crowded with tourists with bars springing up close together. If the red light areas of Patpong or Soi Cowboy are famous for their tricks and sometimes cutting off customers, then Nana Plaza is considered more civilized, but no less vibrant.

A convoy of antique Vespa vehicles carrying Western tourists around Saigon
In addition to double-decker buses, cyclos or river buses, foreign visitors to Ho Chi Minh City also have another option: taking an ancient Vespa tour to explore the city.
Mr. Hoai Nam, living in Ho Chi Minh City, said that on the afternoon of December 28, he saw a group of vintage Vespa vehicles, the driver wearing a prominent orange hat, moving on the road from Tran Hung Dao to Calmette Street, District 1. 1. Each car has a foreign passenger sitting in the back, "causing curiosity" for many people traveling on the road.
Mr. Nam shared that this was the first time he saw a large group of antique cars carrying foreign passengers on the streets of Saigon. Previously, he had only seen cyclos carrying tourists around the city, so this type of travel by antique Vespa was strange to him.
Drivers at an old Vespa tour organizer in Ho Chi Minh City share that tours are usually scheduled for sessions during the day. The time frame that attracts interested guests is usually the evening tour and each company designs its own program, taking guests to different sightseeing and dining stops. Activities on the tour usually include taking tourists around central roads in District 1 and District 3, and experiencing cuisine at street food stalls, alley shops or luxury restaurants. Each tour usually lasts 4 hours and costs less than 2 million VND per person.
In addition to driving responsibilities, the tour driver needs to take good care of tourists such as putting on and taking off helmets for them, chatting and introducing the beauty of the city, suggesting local dishes and drinks, the ancient Vespa tour driver said.
A representative of Klook Vietnam said that this e-commerce platform for travel and experiences is providing about 16 tour programs by vintage Vespa in 4 countries including Vietnam, Italy, Cambodia, and Malaysia. In Vietnam, there are two tours in Ho Chi Minh City inner city priced at 1.6 million VND and a tour from Hanoi to Ninh Binh priced at 1.7 million VND. The program in Saigon usually takes place in the evening from 5:30 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., taking visitors through famous tourist attractions in the city, to small alleys that clearly reflect the lives of local people, and experience culinary experiences. street food and enjoy fresh beer.
Mr. Tran Tuong Huy, Deputy Director of the Institute of Social Tourism Research, said that city discovery tours using vintage Vespas are not a new type of tourism in big cities such as Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi or Hoi An. In Ho Chi Minh City, the first vintage Vespa tour appeared nearly 20 years ago. In recent years, some organizations have increased recognition by repainting their vehicles, wearing helmets and colorful shirts, and printing prominent logos.
Vespa tour is in the city tour group in Ho Chi Minh City, along with a number of similar products such as double-decker bus tour, District 1 night tour, urban waterway tour, taking tourists through the city center areas. Each tour allows visitors to experience a different type of transportation. The vintage Vespa tour attracts most inbound tourists because motorbikes are a "specialty" in Vietnam in general and Ho Chi Minh City in particular. Exploring the city by motorbike gives foreign visitors a closer feel of the lifestyle of local people.
Tours to explore the city by local transportation are not unique to Vietnam. Each country has a type of tourism corresponding to its typical means of transportation. For example, Thailand also has a city tour by tuk tuk that mainly attracts foreign visitors to experience, Mr. Huy said.
According to Mr. Huy, the tour uses antique Vespa cars originating from Italy, making foreign tourists, especially European groups, "feel familiar". During the 1960-1970 period, this type of car appeared a lot on the streets of European countries, but now there are not many left. Therefore, when coming to Vietnam, Western visitors can easily find a feeling of closeness when sitting on these cars and walking around the streets.
Mr. Huy believes that a tour to explore the city by motorbike is basically a type of experiential tourism, contributing to the city's tourism economy. In order for this tour to develop and avoid chaos on the streets of bustling cities like Ho Chi Minh City, there should be some regulations on parking to pick up and wait for passengers.
Besides a series of newly launched tourism products, the classic Vespa tour still quietly has its own place in Ho Chi Minh City. In September, the Indian news site Press Trust of India (PTI) had an article praising the tour to explore Saigon by vintage motorbike, calling it a "vibrant journey".

Chinese tourists are tricked into slavery when buying cheap tours
A Chinese tourist bought a cheap tour to travel to Southeast Asia for 7 days but was kidnapped upon arrival.
A 26-year-old man surnamed Zhang from Hubei province was rescued after 3 years of being kidnapped and forced to work for an online gambling ring in a Southeast Asian country.
Responding to Jimu News, Zhang said that in November 2019, he bought a 7-day tour to a Southeast Asian country but the travel company did not disclose the specific destination. The tour price is 630 USD, cheaper than the market price of 420 USD.
Zhang was excited about the trip, but when he landed he was taken straight to a factory in the city. Upon arriving, the driver told him: "Get off the bus, from now on you will work here." The male tourist was very scared when his phone, ID card, and passport were confiscated. When he tried to protest, he was beaten by his kidnappers.
Zhang's daily job at this place is sales, convincing people to join the online gambling platform. Zhang was not good at speaking, so his work efficiency was poor and he was often beaten.
Six months after the kidnapping, a manager told Zhang he could be released to go home if he paid 111,000 yuan ($15,500). Zhang's parents paid the ransom, but the man was then sold to a second company. The scam of Zhang and his family repeated. In order to save their son, his parents used all their savings to pay the scammers $140,000, but their son still could not return.
Once beaten and seriously injured, Zhang had to be hospitalized. Here he asked a local travel agent to make a new passport. In the end, that person sold Zhang to a third company. At the third place, while the scammers weren't paying attention, Zhang contacted the local police. In October 2022, he was rescued.
Zhang decided to share her story to warn people to be careful when traveling internationally. "You should choose a reputable travel company and if you receive promises and tour prices that are unbelievably good, you should reconsider," Zhang said.
The story quickly spread throughout China. Many people were shocked to hear the news. "Many people still believe in cheap travel with good tours. It's a trap," one person commented.
Being deceived and sold into slavery like Zhang's case is no longer new in China. Often people will be deceived by accepting "dream jobs" such as high-paying light jobs and then being kidnapped and beaten at work.

Phu Quoc Marriage Proposal was praised by American newspapers
Kissing Bridge is considered a unique check-in point in Phu Quoc and will be the next famous bridge with international visitors after the Golden Bridge in Da Nang.
CNN gives a lot of praise to Kiss bridge, a new destination opened on December 22 in Phu Quoc. Accordingly, the bridge is "a new check-in point, where couples can share romantic moments under the Vietnamese sunset".

Kissing Bridge is a project designed by famous Italian architect Marco Casamonti. The bridge is more than 800 meters long, inspired by the painting by artistic genius Michelangelo "Creation of Adam" on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, Vatican and O Thuoc Bridge in the legend of Ong Ngau and Ba Ngau.
The bridge consists of two branches, North and South, forming a unified whole but not touching but 30 cm apart.

Nha Trang Port stopped welcoming domestic passenger ships for 6 months
Khanh Hoa
Nha Trang Port stopped receiving domestic passenger ships and only welcomed international passengers for 6 months for repairs due to deterioration.
On December 28, Khanh Hoa Provincial People's Committee said there was a document agreeing to temporarily suspend Nha Trang port operations. During the repair process, the port will not welcome domestic passenger ships, so localities are required to notify tourism units related to this type of ship to develop appropriate business plans during the temporary suspension. .
International tourist ships will still be accepted. However, Nha Trang Maritime Port Authority in coordination with Nha Trang Port Joint Stock Company needs to develop a plan to ensure safety, security, and environmental sanitation in the port area to carry out international passenger pick-up and drop-off. By water transport (tender) is convenient and safe during maintenance.
Nha Trang Port was formed on the basis of receiving items left behind by the old regime before 1975. At this time, only cargo ships of less than 3,000 DWT (a unit measuring the safe transport capacity of a ship) were allowed to dock at the port. Later, the locality borrowed domestic credit capital to upgrade the wharf to 10,000 DWT with a length of 172 m.
According to Nha Trang Port Joint Stock Company, the seaport area has seriously degraded after long-term use and the effects of weather. In addition, the port's original goal of loading and unloading goods has now transformed its function into an international tourist port, so the infrastructure cannot meet the increasing demands of tourists, so it needs maintenance. maintenance.

The Eiffel Tower is closed
France
The Eiffel Tower had to close due to a staff strike on December 27, the 100th anniversary of the death of the father of this structure - Gustave Eiffel.
The one-day strike was launched by the French General Trade Union (CGT) to protest the current way of managing the tower. CGT condemned the operator for working under an "over-ambitious" business model, which will lead to "unsustainable development". A representative of the tower management unit said Eiffel is expected to reopen today.
As one of the most visited places in the world, the Eiffel Tower is usually open all year round although sometimes affected by strikes. In 2022, the tower will welcome nearly 5.9 million visitors, a record number since the pandemic. In 2019, the tower welcomed more than 6 million visitors. This year, the tower welcomes about 20,000 visitors every day.
Many tourists expressed disappointment when they saw a large iron sign placed in front of the tower announcing the closure in many languages ​​and apologizing "for this inconvenience". Visitors can still access the glass-enclosed promenade below the tower but cannot go up to visit.
The Fontaine family said the tower's closure "was a huge blow" to them. "The first time we brought our children to Paris and visiting Eiffel was the first activity in the program. We were extremely disappointed when the tower closed," said female tourist Emma Fontaine. Dutch tourist Istvan Harman expressed his "acceptance" of the truth and said "we have to go somewhere else to visit".
The Eiffel Tower, the symbol of France, is 324 m high and is a "must check in" place for most first-time visitors to Paris. The project was designed by architect Gustave Eiffel and his colleagues and built from 1887 to 1889, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. In 2022, the Eiffel Tower was warned that it was "in a state of serious deterioration" when most of the tower was rusted and needed complete repair. However, the tower has only been repainted at a cost of 60 million euros to serve the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris.

5 things you can and cannot do in Antarctica
Living in Antarctica is like "living in a freezer" because the surroundings are cold but in return there are no insects like mosquitoes living here.
Two scientists Julie and Austin Carter shared about daily life in Antarctica to help visitors better understand this land with a harsh climate.
Both are living at McMurdo station, established in 1955. They will live here for another two months to study ancient ice samples. "The ice here is over a million years old. We're really interested in studying past climate," Austin explains.
In a video shared on their personal page, the couple shared about 5 things they can and cannot do when living in remote Antarctica.
The first thing is that they cannot shower while here because there is no running water. With drinking water, the two scientists will boil the surrounding ice to get broth. People can absolutely go out in freezing weather and just wear lots of layers. The coldest temperature recorded at Vostok station, also a record low on earth, was -89.2 degrees Celsius on July 21, 1983.
We can't see the sunset here, Julie said. Due to the tilt of the Earth's axis and being very far south, Antarctica is in summer so the sun shines 24/7 in the sky. "So it's always bright," Julie said.
They said it was almost midnight when the video was taken, but it was still as bright as noon in most other places on earth.
Where they both live, "wildlife cannot be seen." The two scientists stay inland while the animals live along the coast. "Every once in a while we see a bird. It's pretty cool," Austin said.
The last thing the two scientists want to share is that the outdoor space is like a freezer, very convenient for storing food. "There were no insects or predators around. We basically lived in a freezer," Julie said.
Video posted on December 15. After three days, it has attracted nearly 2 million likes and more than 10,000 comments. "Living in Antarctica is really worth it if I never have to see a spider," said one person who left a comment after sharing that the place where the two scientists lived was "insect-free." "I'd go crazy if I didn't shower for 50 days," another commented.
When someone asked a question about the living conditions in Antarctica and whether the two scientists were warm in the room, Austin replied: "Thanks for watching the video. We eat, sleep in tents and have stove to warm up. But it's the people who make this place cozy."
Antarctica has long been a favorite destination for many adventurous tourists. According to the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO), in 2022-2023, the southernmost region of the hemisphere recorded a record number of visitors with 105,331 people. Tourists coming here spend an average of about 12,700 USD per trip. Experts predict that the number of visitors will increase in the near future.

Vietnamese tourists are begged for money in the poorest country in the world
Likes to find "naked" and unique tourist destinations, Quoc wants to once witness life in Burundi, the country ranked the poorest in the world in 2022.
The trip of Phan Thanh Quoc (Ke Du Muc), living in Ho Chi Minh City, was made in November last year. According to the World Food Program (WFP), 70% of Burundi's population lives in poverty, 52% of children under 5 years old suffer from rickets and malnutrition, and this number may be even higher in rural areas. village. High rates of infectious diseases and difficulty accessing clean water make people's lives even more difficult.
After finishing the trip to Rwanda, Quoc entered the country by land, through Cendajuru commune in northeastern Burundi. Here, Quoc was given a temporary entry paper and asked to go to Bujumbura, Burundi's largest city, to get a visa, a process that cost him two fees. In addition, Quoc was also asked to pay for a Covid-19 test, but he said no one checked.
With a distance of 2 km to Bujumbura, which used to be the capital, Vietnamese tourists soon experienced a situation of cutting corners when a taxi driver asked him for up to 20,000 BIF (about 170,000 VND) but when asked a second person, the amount The closing price is reduced to 3,000 BIF (about 25,000 VND).
Quoc only stayed in Bujumbura for a short time and then took a bus to the capital Gitega. At the bus station, he quickly became a "celebrity". Dozens of young men appeared and surrounded him. At first, they only showed curiosity about the rare appearance of foreigners, constantly asking questions like where did they come from and what were they doing here.
It was raining. Quoc sat in a taxi waiting to collect enough passengers, but the crowd had not yet left. They continuously banged on the car door, asking the Vietnamese tourists to get out and give them money. Some people tugged on the door handle, causing the taxi window to shake.
Honestly, I don't remember how many times I've experienced this scene. I'm not scared but feel disturbed, he said. After that, he got out of the car and a man approached, asking Quoc to give him money.
Quoc said that in poor African countries, every day he goes out on the street, he often carries a few million dong to donate to some difficult situations. However, in this chaotic crowd, giving money is impossible because "if one person has it, everyone will ask for it". Even though Quoc refused, the man still persisted in asking for money. It all ended when the taxi started rolling.
Quoc was also surprised by the scene of cars lining up a kilometer long waiting for gas. According to local people, gasoline is still scarce in this country, the number of gas stations is small, so people have to wait a long time to fill up. At a gas station, Quoc also saw employees spreading spike nets on the ground to avoid vehicles cutting in line.
In the capital, Gitega, life is busier, with people always carrying packages on their heads to offer for sale, be it food or bags of mineral water. People's means of transportation is mainly bicycles and most of the roads are still dirt roads.
Quoc also "died" when he witnessed a man scavenging trash and eating it greedily at a landfill right on the street. He approached and gave the man some money before leaving. "I can't help everyone here, but I want to give some support," he said.
However, giving money and food in Burundi also brought many problems for Quoc. If just a few people were accepted, dozens of others would come and ask, making him always have to find a way to escape the chaotic crowd. He was also asked for money by some stores because his appearance "caused people to gather and the store couldn't sell". Quoc reluctantly agreed to pay a store owner 1,000 BIF (about 8,500 VND). Because he had no change, Quoc gave the boss 5,000 BIF, but he did not return the change. After a long argument, Quoc received 4,000 BIF back.
Despite some bad experiences, Quoc still found many positive things during his three weeks in Burundi. According to him, the people here are quite friendly. They enjoy the camera and often come closer to take pictures. In particular, they always smile even though daily life is difficult.

Sa Pa, Ha Long cruise is 'burned' with rooms for New Year's Eve
Sa Pa and destinations near Hanoi, easily accessible by car, are attracting a large number of tourists during the New Year holiday.
In the northern region, statistics from the Mustgo booking platform with 2,000 hotel partners nationwide show that the Ha Long cruise is almost fully booked, mainly with international guests.
Mr. Bui Thanh Tu, Marketing Director of Best Price, also said that groups that booked "last minute" had no more seats. During the New Year, Best Price recorded more than 1,000 bookings with a total of 3,000 guests with the Ha Long Bay cruise product - all foreign guests. Customers still maintain the habit of booking early, the company records the first orders from November 2022. According to Mr. Tu, foreign tourists always consider Ha Long Bay as the top destination for vacations, especially New Year's Eve.
Another point where this platform also recorded a room occupancy rate of up to 90% is Sa Pa. 5-star hotels in Sa Pa basically have 70% room capacity and have sold out all low-cost room categories. The 3-4 star segment is almost empty.
Ha Giang is also a place with a high possibility of running out of rooms during the upcoming holidays. A representative of the Ha Giang Provincial Tourism Association said there are no complete statistics, but members noted "very crowded, many places full of rooms". Mr. Lai Quoc Tinh, Chairman of the Board of Directors of H'Mong Village, said that the facility has sold out all rooms from December 30 to January 1, 2024.
For the Da Nang - Hoi An area, Mustgo's data shows that room occupancy is at a good level, fluctuating 40-60% in Da Nang and 85-90% in Hoi An. Hotel rooms near Da Nang beach are "more popular" than in the city.
Some destinations in the southern region also benefit from the influx of international visitors such as Phu Quoc and Nha Trang. Mustgo representative said that the 5-star segment in Phu Quoc has an average occupancy rate of over 80%, and the 3-4 star segment is almost out of rooms. Vietnamese guests only account for 20% of the total number of guests booking rooms in Phu Quoc during this period.
In Nha Trang city, international 5-star hotels have reached 90% capacity, Vietnamese 5-star hotels are about 30%. In the Cam Ranh area, the international 5-star segment reached 90% thanks to both international and group visitors, the Vietnamese 5-star segment is similar in Nha Trang city.
In Phan Thiet, the average capacity is about 45-60% because there are mainly resorts serving relaxation needs. Mustgo said some hotels do not charge extra fees and require a minimum stay of two nights during this occasion, similar to other peak occasions.
However, room capacity in Ha Long city has only reached about 30-40%. The reason is that the north is in the cold season, not suitable for fun activities at the beach. Records from the Mustgo platform show that the room occupancy rate in Thanh Hoa is not high during this period.
Mr. Nguyen Nhat Vu - Vice Chairman of Lam Dong Tourism Association, said that Da Lat had a decrease in domestic tourists during this year's holidays, possibly due to economic problems. The report from the association shows that room capacity in small hotels is only 50%, the 3-star segment and above is relatively stable. Meanwhile, a representative of Dalattourist, a large travel agency in Da Lat, said that the number of customers making reservations at restaurants in their system has decreased by up to 50% compared to the same period last year.
Best Price's airline ticket office data shows that the price of one-way air tickets from Ho Chi Minh City - Da Lat for the period December 29 to January 1 is about 3.8 million VND round trip, up 1.6 times compared to the beginning of the month and 1.1 times compared to a week earlier. The lowest round-trip ticket price from Hanoi in the period December 29 to January 1 is about 4.6 million VND, while the average price on weekdays is about 2.5 million VND - according to data from Google.
Another locality also forecasting a decline in visitors is Vung Tau - with an average room occupancy rate of only 30%, according to Mustgo. In the Ho Tram area alone, resort rooms are almost sold out thanks to the influx of golfers. Representatives of the Ba Ria - Vung Tau Tourism Association also predicted a decrease in visitors this year, the main reason being that visitors from Ho Chi Minh City have many other options and the general economy is poor.

India wants to prevent rich people from going abroad to get married
The Indian Prime Minister urged people to "celebrate their wedding on Indian soil" instead of destinations like Thailand, Bali or Maldives.
Tourism in the region is gradually returning to pre-epidemic levels. More and more wealthy Indian families are inviting friends and relatives to weddings in luxury destinations across Southeast Asia and beyond such as Thailand, Bali, Phu Quoc, and the Maldives.
Luxurious weddings of Bollywood stars and the elite have long been the focus of media attention. Today they are attracting interest for another reason: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is unhappy with people spending on lavish weddings abroad.
Mr. Modi is concerned that getting married abroad will cause damage to the country's tourism trade. "A new trend is growing that families are having weddings abroad. Is this necessary?", Mr. Modi said on Mann Ki Baat radio in late November. He said that if people If you organize a wedding in the country, "money stays in the country", instead of flowing abroad like today. Rich people going abroad for weddings and tourism does not help India create more jobs for its people.
The Prime Minister's comments came in the context of India's wedding and tourism industry having "a bumper season". According to the Federation of Indian Traders, about 3.5 million Indian couples will get married from November 23 until the end of the year, generating revenue of 60.2 billion USD.
Biswajit Dhar, professor of economics at the Council for Social Development, a think tank in New Delhi, India's trade balance - the difference between the value of exports and imports - is at risk in context of a slowing global economy.
India has been named the fastest-growing major economy by the International Monetary Fund, but Mr. Dhar said the decline in the rupee is increasing costs because most of this growth comes from imports. "Anything that causes a drain on foreign exchange can be very serious," Dhar said, referring to lavish weddings abroad.
Representatives of the Indian tourism industry said they are preparing to tighten regulations. One of them is to be able to impose higher taxes on any overseas spending by people that exceeds the prescribed ceiling.
Rajeev Kohli, president of Euromic, a non-profit marketing association of destination management companies specializing in event planning, opposes the policy. "It is not appropriate for the government to regulate how taxpayers' money is spent," Kohli said. The head of Euromic added that the new policy is unfair to a certain segment of tourists.
Southeast Asian countries like Thailand and Indonesia are attracting wealthy Indians who want to get married abroad. Those in the Indian tourism industry say this trend should be encouraged. "The government should be proud that overseas weddings promote an understanding of the spending power of Indians," said Kohli.
Rich Indians are known to be international tourists who spend heavily on wedding services abroad. In addition to renting luxury resorts, they also spare no expense in hiring Michelin-starred chefs and famous singers to serve at their weddings. Middle-class families also "splash money" on luxuries such as hiring a helicopter to transport the bride and groom to the wedding venue. A high-end Indian wedding with fresh tulips shipped straight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, specially designed dresses for the bride and bridesmaids, and expensive gifts for guests can cost $5 million.
In the context of increasing spending on weddings by Indians, tourism experts say that Prime Minister Modi's comments "only have limited impact" and will hardly stop rich people from continuing to go abroad for weddings. .
Sumit Agarwal, professor of economics at National University, said the way for India to get back the money people bring abroad for weddings is to build infrastructure and upgrade high-end wedding venues. domestic. Agarwal believes that Thailand is one of the "great" destinations to hold a wedding because it knows how to take advantage of its existing infrastructure. But this is "really a big problem" for India.
India is growing its tourism industry, but Agarwal said it is "not promoting luxury travel for those who don't consider cost an issue".
India is blessed with many attractive locations, spanning the Himalayan mountains and vast deserts, with secluded white sandy beaches. Tourism industry experts say the remote Andaman and Nicobar Islands or Lakshadweep can easily compete with overseas destinations for weddings if infrastructure is improved.
Ekta Sharma, director of Khyaath Design Holidays in Gurugram, said she helped a couple from the Philippines organize a week-long wedding in the pink city of Jaipur. She booked venues in former royal palaces and luxury hotels for international guests.
But India cannot always meet the wishes of rich wedding guests because high-end hotels here do not have enough supply. "We will be happy to promote wedding venues in India. But right now the destinations are not ready," Sharma said.
