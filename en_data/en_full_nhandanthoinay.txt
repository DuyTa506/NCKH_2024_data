From Ha Giang city, follow Highway 4C north about 47 km to reach Nam Dam village. On the journey, when tourists arrive at the People's Committee of Quan Ba ​​commune, they should ask for directions or look at the sign pointing to Nai waterfall and then turn onto this road. On the way to the waterfall, you will pass through Nam Dam village and then the scenery of the village, terraced fields, green mountain slopes, vegetable fields and the Dao people's houses makes you come up with the idea of ​​staying here. a few nights to enjoy the peaceful scenery.
Starting from that pulling scene and the demand of guests wanting to stay overnight, at first the whole village had only three households opening homestays. Over time, more tourists came, causing many other families to open homestays to give guests a place to stay.
The house has the advantage of being cool in the summer and warm in the winter. Ms. Phan Thi Lien, a homestay owner, said that at the end of 2018, the People's Committee of Ha Giang province promoted local tourism, encouraging the repair of traditional houses to do accommodation services, so Ms. Lien and her husband and children were able to received support of 60 million VND to build a report house. Just like that, many families in the village have followed this path, both farming and tourism and preserving the unique cultural features of the people.
Nam Dam village still has a ramshackle bamboo fence and a shaky gravel path, but it is friendly and close. Coming to Nam Dam, I feel like I have fallen into a deep hole in the sky, limited in space surrounded by mountains. In one day, if you don't see clouds floating at the top of this mountain, you will see clouds at the top of that mountain. It feels like the clouds keep moving and are "afraid" of people so they keep "hanging" on the top of the mountain. But sometimes clouds also rush over people's feet as if "afraid" of being caught.
The nights in Nam Dam are cool and cool, making it easy for guests to fall asleep to the lullaby of insects. It was a deep sleep in the thick wall, in the warm brocade blanket and mattress.

The story goes that in the past, a group went to survey the road connecting the flower city of Da Lat (Lam Dong) with the coastal city of Nha Trang (Khanh Hoa). From the vast dark forests, after a night of sleeping in a tent, waking up in the morning, they saw dew drops in the morning sunlight that were more beautiful than many other places, they called it "the glittering road".
Long Lanh Pass is 30 km long through the Lang Biang mountain range and Bidoup National Park. Da Chais commune, where the pass "creeps" through, has a large area (341.04 km2) nearly half the area of ​​Bac Ninh province (823.1 km2) and is a commune adjacent to three provinces of Ninh Thuan and Khanh Hoa. and Dak Lak.
The land is large, few people live, so the air is fresh. There are many types of precious wood here, but there is one tree that needs to be mentioned: the wind tree that produces agarwood. For many people who used to work in finding agarwood, they are not unfamiliar with the forests here. If you can approach them and are really friendly, they will reveal to you a few secrets such as listening to birds chirping at night to guess the location of the wind tree. And the next morning, they will follow the sound of birds singing last night to find the area with bass.
In the pass routes conquered to reach Da Lat, each pass section is an impressive destination. But for a traveler, just "riding a horse to see flowers" is enough. Enjoying this pass by motorbike not only challenges your ability to sit on the saddle when going through curves but also makes you show your bravery. Avoid expressing emotions before the poetic beauty of winding mountains and forests.
It is a rare thing for someone to see mist covering vast mountains and hills. It's also not easy to have moments of watching the sun rise or cast shadows while there are still dew drops lingering on the plants and trees. And it is also difficult to have moments when the soul feels like it is freed from the cramped urban conditions and replaced by pure, light emptiness. Try conquering Long Lanh Pass once to get an exciting experience. You are so precious that nothing can be exchanged.

And stepping inside each house is like returning to a past region with the opening sentence from before, that day. Today, in every house there are still wood stoves, cast iron pots, and bamboo baskets and utensils. And dangling above the kitchen counter was a small circle of soot like an archipelago's nest. The Nung people still like to cook with wood stoves to keep the house warm and because they can take advantage of dry pine branches and wild trees every time they go up the mountain.
People here live on fields and pine hills for resin. Slowly chatting will help us hear simple everyday stories in the language of our people, bringing us back to our childhood and innocence. It could be a story about a rooster fighting with a dog or a cow, a buffalo criticizing the cold winter hay for not dressing, a threat that makes guests and owners burst into laughter.
This season is also the season when reeds produce white flowers that cover the border areas. If you have valid papers, the border guards will take you to landmark 1268. The road to the landmark goes through winding pine forests. Pine trees here are people's livelihood, so the entrance to the forest is rarely cleaned. On the way, you will hear the sound of pine trees whispering like a story.
The stream winding through Ban Chat flows from high mountains in the east of Dinh Lap district and the west of Binh Lieu district (Quang Ninh), so it is very cold. This is also the source of the Ky Cung River. On this road, remember to visit Po Hang communal house. This is an ancient communal house built by the people to worship King Dinh Tien Hoang. Legend has it that this communal house is also where young people in the village held oaths to fight the enemy and protect the country every year.
Coming to Ban Chat today, you can also see traders and sellers at the newly opened border gate, which was previously just a border market. After a long day, if you can't buy anything by hand, you can still get many other things with your eyes and ears when you see and talk to people.

Majestic and overwhelming is the feeling of most people when the boat stops right in front of Tu San alley, admiring the two giant cliffs nearly 900 meters high that nature has created over millions of years.

Ton Duc Thang has 19 trees... Each tree has a different shape and height, while the round roots below are like a part of the dialogue about life here, of the past days with many heavy hearts and many wishes. tells about the land of sun, wind and vitality. It feels like the almond trees quietly tell stories every day with their wide branches and leaves full of life, contrasting with the rough roots below.
When you go to Con Dao in October and November, you will also receive gifts from almond trees, which are fallen almonds. After a season on the tree, the almond fruit has absorbed the air from the far sea, gathering minerals absorbed in the island's soil. For months, the fruit nestles in the leaves, sings with the sun, and finally falls on the roadside to give to guests from far away. Bring it back to another region to grow seeds.
Going to Con Dao, in addition to seeing people picking up almond seeds to dry and roast to make jam - a gift from the sea, you can also hear about the trunks of almond trees in prisons in the past, which used to be places for secret letters and records. Signs of Con Dao prisoners. Young almond leaves are also used as food. Dried almond leaves are burned by prisoners to make ink to send information to each other.

If you feel heavy in your heart, just walk under the shade of green trees and gently hug the tree trunk with your arms, you will receive a feeling of peace, release and immense joy.

It is a collection of bamboo types that the owner and his colleagues dug up from Ha Giang to the tip of Ca Mau, from the islands to the high mountains of the Northwest and Central Highlands. This bamboo collection, about 90% Vietnamese bamboo, 10% imported bamboo, according to the introduction, is the largest bamboo collection in Southeast Asia.
Going around the bamboo garden, looking at this bush growing bamboo shoots, another species has closed its reproductive cycle and suddenly thought of its uses. Bamboo shoots evoke food, bamboo stalks make stakes, poles, bamboo branches make whips to teach rural children in the past, and bamboo is split by the skillful hands of artisans and woven into utensils such as baskets, nets, baskets, sieves. ...but bamboo leaves are useless. Only in areas where it was difficult to find firewood in the past did people sweep up leaves to cook. Many types of bamboo plants have thorns and people still call them by the common name "bamboo gai", but when they grow in the same garden, bamboo gai also has other names, named after the shape of the branches and thorns with different characteristics. Funny names like "loc loc", "crab thorn", "virgin flower thorn"...
When entering the bamboo village, don't go in a hurry. Standing in front of the bamboo bushes, we should be silent, look and think, language suddenly pops up inside us that each type of bamboo has its own characteristics. Bamboo thorns weave their branches together, the bamboo thorns create a point of attachment, the tree trunk just stands straight and reaches high. That's why the Lo O tree grows in the forest, its trunk leans against the forest tree and stands straight. "Returning to the village" it seems to be at a loss. Standing is more difficult than lying down, so it relies on the bamboo shoots growing proudly.
It is known that this bamboo conservation area was inaugurated in 2004, so it has been nearly 20 years. When entering the bamboo village, you should choose a sunny day. In the dry season, it is even more beautiful because you can step on the dry bamboo leaves and make a clicking sound, while fresh bamboo leaves in the light breeze make a crackling sound like the sound of rain on the porch. Walking under the bamboo rows gives us an extremely relaxing feeling.

1/At the end of March this year, BCRA exploration experts announced that they had discovered dozens more pristine and "very different" caves in the west of Quang Binh - quite far from Phong Nha-Ke National Park. Bang. Accordingly, during a three-week survey in Minh Hoa and Tuyen Hoa districts (Quang Binh), cave experts discovered 22 new caves that are still pristine, without human footprints, nearly 12 meters long. kilometer. It is worth mentioning that among the 22 new caves, there are five caves in the limestone mountains in Lam Hoa commune, Tuyen Hoa district with a length of more than 3.3 km. According to the world's leading expert on caves Howard Limbert, in Lam Hoa there is a 278 m deep cave with a waterfall flowing down and it is certainly still deeper but the explorers do not have enough equipment to survey it all so make an appointment. come back next time.
“These are quite young caves and most of them are wet caves, with very beautiful stalactites. They are small caves but quite interesting, especially compared to many of the caves we found in Quang Binh. If Son Doong, En Cave and many other caves have only one main entrance, this new cave system has many different entrances and exits. Some caves are still interconnected, creating many horizontal paths, making trips around inside very interesting," Mr. Howard Limbert shared.
The discovery of many beautiful caves in the Tuyen Hoa limestone area is attracting public attention. Recently, in the forest area of ​​Dieu Do village, Truong Son commune, Quang Ninh district (Quang Binh), local people have discovered A cave appears with a system of stalactites and an underground stream with many mysteries. The cave is more than 1.5 km long, the highest point of the cave entrance is about 30 m. In the cave there are many beautiful stalactites and strange structures. In particular, stalactites flow down like countless curtains and sparkle every time the light shines on them. At some point, white stalactites flow down and spread out like a giant sheet of soft, sparkling white silk. In the summer, there is not much water in the cave, people can swim in rubber boats or paddle boats from the beginning of the cave to the end of the cave for more than 1 hour, from there go to Khe May stream with majestic primeval forest. People temporarily named this cave Son Nu. Chairman of Truong Son Commune People's Committee Hoang Trong Duc said that deep in the Vietnam-Laos border area, under the canopy of primeval forests and countless majestic limestone mountains, there are many caves.
Cave expert couple Howard Limbert and Mr. Ho Khanh on an expedition.
2/With the people of Phong Nha town and the buffer zone of Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park, Howard Limbert and his wife seem to have become close friends. And even Howard himself built a beautiful house on the banks of the Son River as a place to return home after tireless trips through the forest in search of mysteries. “Vietnam and Quang Binh became my second homeland. Therefore, I spend most of my life attached to Phong Nha," Howard said.
Mr. Howard Limbert shared that over the past 30 years, all members of the expedition team, each with a different profession and expertise, have one thing in common: a special passion for caves. They saved their own money and raised funds to realize their passion for exploring caves through a series of expeditions around the world. Upon arriving in Vietnam, knowing the endless potential of caves in Quang Binh, the group of experts cooperated with the University of Natural Sciences (Hanoi National University) to conduct explorations and surveys. and in-depth research on caves.
Mr. Howard Limbert recalled: "During an expedition in 1999, our group finished exploring Khe Ry cave and camped for five days in the cave. This cave becomes the longest cave in Vietnam and can probably be considered the longest underground single river cave in the world. The cave exits in a closed valley connected to the water from En cave. Downstream, both bodies of water enter a sump blocked by trees and boulders. 10 years later, experts discovered that this was the water for Son Doong cave.
Also according to this famous cave expert, in 2009, his team had the opportunity to explore the elusive cave that had been searching for more than 10 years. A local resident named Ho Khanh brought the group of explorers to the entrance he found in 1990, from which Son Doong cave was officially explored with a length of more than 6.5 km and ending at a cave. The giant wall is called the Great Wall of Vietnam. Son Doong was measured and with the data obtained, British exploration experts announced that this is the largest cave ever found in the world.
According to BCRA experts, over the years, the caves in Phong Nha-Ke Bang have contributed to changing the lives of people in the area from awareness and livelihood. Not only are ecotourism models opening, but many people are now working as guides and porters on adventure tours. In Phong Nha, there are now more people participating in adventure cave tours than anywhere else in the world.
3/ In the World Natural Heritage Phong Nha-Ke Bang, many outstanding cave "titles" have been established such as: Son Doong is the largest cave in the world, Khe Ry cave is the longest river cave in the world world and the longest cave in Vietnam. Other caves such as En cave, Pygmy cave and Vom cave are also in the top 10 largest caves in the world. Therefore, British experts believe that the Phong Nha-Ke Bang massif is definitely one of the most important limestone areas in the world. According to Professor Ta Hoa Phuong, Vietnam Institute of Paleontology Research, the World Natural Heritage Phong Nha-Ke Bang is a typical representative of Vietnam in terms of natural heritage values, especially cave wonders. Karst movements have global significance. In this National Park, there exists an underground paradise with a splendor, sparkle, and charm that is not easily found anywhere else. To have such majestic, delicate and magical wonders, in the context of intense tectonic movements that have occurred during the three great periods of Earth's history in this land, Mother Nature has must struggle to "conceive and give birth".
Professor Ta Hoa Phuong said that stalactites in karst caves in Phong Nha-Ke Bang are formed mainly from water sources containing calcium bicarbonate with five types of stalactites: dripping stalactites, flow stalactites, seepage stalactites, and stalactite stalactites. sedimentation lake and condensation emulsion. They contribute to creating the sometimes majestic, majestic, sometimes delicate beauty of the caves here. In addition, in some caves there are also cave gems, which are spherical and oval objects often located in trays like terraced fields, which are products of extremely interesting sedimentary geological processes. There are two types of cave jade: the custard-like type that is created by swirling water during the flood season that has rounded up the travectin mud (pore stone) with heterogeneous composition, and the transparent type with beautiful patterns.
According to Director of Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park Management Board Pham Hong Thai, after 20 years of exploration, survey and research (2003-2023), Mr. Howard Limbert and BCRA experts surveyed and discovered 425 caves, of which 389 caves have been measured with a total length of 243 km. Most prominent is the discovery of Son Doong - the world's largest cave, which has important significance in cave exploration research in the region, making a great contribution to promoting the image of tourism in Vietnam and Quang Binh. and Phong Nha-Ke Bang to the world.
Currently, there are more than 50 caves that have been put into operation and serve tourism, more than 40 caves with tourism potential have been preliminarily surveyed, and 9 caves with tourism potential have been surveyed in detail. Howard Limbert shared that as the caves gradually become known and are put into tourism, it motivates British experts to continue their journey to discover the mysteries and wonders amidst the vast abyss.

Tua Chua district has mountains in the north, and upland areas in the south. The upstream section of the famous ferocious and mysterious river has transformed into a gentle, calm water surface. Majestic rapids and mountains reflect in the vast lake bed. Coming here on days when there are few visitors like these, I can listen to the ferryman leisurely tell stories about the mountain beside me, and we at the mountain become close friends.
Behind the floating white clouds, everyone knows there is a mountain, and each person has their own story of that day and the past. The boatman told the story that in the past, the Dao people crossed the rapids of the Da River and built a mountain. Arriving at the land, I saw 10-gauge sugar cane trees, weeding trees, and accidentally dropped the knife bag into the stream. When I picked it up, the fish had filled the bag, so I decided to stop, settle down, and settle here.
In the past, Huoi So commune was an important waterway traffic artery, known as "the junction of the Da River - the three-way junction of Dien Bien-Son La-Lai Chau province". That day, the banks were deep and the river was shallow. Now, the banks encroaching deep into the valley are the fields of the Dao people. The water rises, the fields also rise, and in the mountains the Dao people grow tea.
Since the day the water was flooded, indigenous people switched to boat transport. The mountains and people here are a combination of mountains and rivers. Women and girls grow tea, men and women work in the river. The mountain is their food storehouse, the water is their life, silently toiling, they diligently complete their work at the foot of the mountain, by the river. Many boatmen not only told stories about growing corn and rice on rocky mountains, they also told about the ancient Tuyet San tea tree, villagers had to climb trees or climb ladders to pick buds.
Coming to Huoi Long, you can also admire the landscape of Tua Chua district, this place, many people consider it a "little" Ha Giang. Tua Chua has many landscapes ranked as National Monuments such as Kho Chua La Cave, Pe Rang Ky, ancient San Tuyet tea forest with nearly 4,000 tea trees hundreds of years old.

Local people said that the church is named Mang Lang because in the past there were many Mang Lang trees in An Thach commune. This is a tree with a wide canopy, oval leaves, and beautiful purple flowers in clusters. The church is named after this tree. Unfortunately, this tree has now disappeared, leaving only traces of a round wooden table with a diameter of 1.7 m made from the wood of the magnolia tree from the time the church was built.
Mang Lang Church was built in 1892, designed in Gothic architecture with many harmonious decorative patterns, subtle artistic features of Vietnamese culture. This is shown through the intricately carved lines on the main door. Stepping into the cathedral, visitors will feel the attractive beauty of antiquity emanating from the characteristic blue-gray walls that have faded over time. If compared to other churches in Vietnam such as Notre Dame Cathedral, Phu Nhai Church, Tra Co Church, Con Ga Church, wooden church... then Mang Lang Church is not too large and the interior is not too large. fussily. But perhaps that simplicity is what makes this church so attractive and special.
Today, Mang Lang church is the place to keep and preserve the book "Eight-day sermon", the first printed book with 319 pages in the national language in our country. The book was printed in 1651 in Rome (Italy) compiled by cleric Alexandre de Rhodes. Over hundreds of years, the book is still carefully preserved and solemnly displayed in a glass box. Visitors here can read the first page of the catechism in bilingual form, including Latin (left) and early national language (right).
Existing for more than a hundred years, Mang Lang church is like a historical witness, a unique architectural work. Coming to Phu Yen, in addition to the rocky reefs, the steppe where there are "yellow flowers on green grass", and the long beaches, perhaps this place is also a favorite destination for many people on a trip to experience the central region. .

It can be said that children are the happiest and benefit the most on this occasion. Right from June (lunar calendar), neighborhoods, schools, and youth art and culture clubs have been preparing for the new festival season. From finding ideas, materials, design, implementation... attracting people of all ages and occupations. When the lanterns take shape, every night around 7-8 p.m., people carry the lanterns early. All over the main roads, a series of giant lighted vehicles paraded one after another to the sound of music and the sounds of children laughing and talking. Each model is an outstanding creative product with rich inspiration from folk legends, fairy tales, folk songs, Vietnamese literature... Besides, there are also lamp models simulating comic book characters, Modern movies that children love.
My friend lives in Hanoi but also takes advantage of the weekends to bring his small family back to his hometown. You invited me to come along to see how beautiful and proud Tuyen Quang Mid-Autumn Festival is. Indeed, I have seen grandparents and parents seem to have a "ticket to childhood", while children are cared for, loved and have the opportunity to learn about traditional culture. Mid-Autumn Festival is Children's Day, which is also the Reunion Festival. If you do not come to Tuyen Quang during the Mid-Autumn Festival, you can arrange a trip about two weeks in advance and still enjoy watching the lights, walking around, and checking in in the bustling, festive atmosphere. sacred.
In the past, when books and newspapers were few and there were no forms of technological entertainment, participating in making lanterns and the Mid-Autumn Festival lantern procession was a source of happiness and anticipation that lasted several months. Nowadays, every lamp is elaborate and sophisticated, carried by motor vehicles, equipped with speakers and transmitters. Although many things have changed, the value and meaning of the festival remains intact, which is the great love for the preschool generation, and the spirit of solidarity of the whole community.

The road to the ancient temple has tall, shady trees that always give a feeling of peace. That is a row of mother-of-pearl trees planted on both sides of the road leading to the historical Nua temple area, in Nua town (Trieu Son), a land with the old name of Co Dinh of Thanh. This land has many ancient houses and local people often speak to each other in the local language with syllables very different from the common language, so the Thanh people call it Co Dinh language.
When turning into the row of mother-of-pearl trees, a question appeared in my mind that, in a farming area, growing crops and in the past there was a year-round shortage of firewood, people only cooked with straw or on off days, they went to the mountains to cut mulch. Carry them back to dry for firewood, but how can they still keep this row of trees? The mother-of-pearl trees are tall, have large roots, and have no signs of sawing or pruning on the tops.
The rows of mother-of-pearl are rice fields and ponds, with no houses, creating an airy space. The nacre trees live in the village fields, near the hardworking and simple people, making the trees resilient in the face of harsh nature. There was no storm that caused the tree to lose its roots or break its branches, even though the tree's stance was previously a small dirt road, which was later concreted to avoid mud on rainy days and dust on dry sunny days. Perhaps because of this, flood and storm prevention departments have no reason to cut branches and lower tree tops to create a safe corridor like in big cities or densely populated areas.
What is the reason why the tree is so durable and comfortably spreads its branches and tops like that? Many people living nearby explained that because the tree roots were deeply embedded in the ground, the trunk and top of the tree were not damaged, so rainwater did not penetrate the tree trunk, creating rotten "tumors".
Many old people in the village said that the rows of mother-of-pearl trees were planted during the French colonial period, in 1923. At that time, the road surface was still low, and after many years, the tree stumps also had large roots, creating resting places and seats for people. People work in the fields and enjoy the fresh air. In 2022, the row of trees will be recognized as a Heritage Tree. This year is also the 100th anniversary of the row of trees with cool paths, for those who want to return.

Income "changes skin"
Moc Chau district is famous for its vast tea hills. Not only is it a perennial industrial crop with high yields, tea also creates landscapes, contributing to the development of ecotourism. Growing up with tea trees, Ms. Phan Thi Hoa (45 years old), a tea maker at Tea Team 66, Vinatea Moc Chau branch, clearly noticed the changes in her homeland in general and tea production in particular when tourism developed. development. “Tea making is very poor, sometimes there is not enough food to eat. Purchasing prices were low, at times many tea selling households switched to other occupations. Dirt and muddy roads are difficult to navigate. Dear people, it takes a long time to find a home. It used to be like that, now it's completely different. Many tourists visit, tea is more valuable, many families take advantage of the tea hills as tourism services. The economy is noticeably better off, and thanks to that, my children are able to get a good education," she shared.
Tourism "breathes" a new source of life into the lives of farmers who have been attached to green tea buds all their lives. After 10 years of working in tourism, Mr. Nguyen Van Tai (62 years old), owner of a kiosk at Tea Village 69 tourist area (Moc Chau Farm town, Moc Chau district), clearly understands each stage of development of the tourism industry. tourism - agriculture in this highland area. Previously, Mr. Tai both harvested and worked as a worker at the tea factory, this was the family's main income: "Not poor, not rich, just enough to eat, sometimes it was very difficult", he recounted. Taking advantage of the relatively flat hill terrain and an open space facing the road, his family and a number of other households with surrounding tea hills opened to sell tea: "Initially, about 6 or 7 years ago, People who have tea around here do not invite anyone to sell iced tea. At first it was simply a place for people coming home from work in the hot sun to drink a cup of soft drink, a place for old men to drink a cup of tea and smoke a pipe. Gradually, children came to gather, many tourists came, and it gradually developed," Mr. Tai added.
Also according to Mr. Tai, in 2018, Vinatea Moc Chau branch implemented a project to develop Moc Chau tea village tourism. Tourism households are supported by the company with facilities (building kiosks, roofs...), and sharing profits from introducing and selling Moc Chau tea products to tourists. This helps "amateur" farmers and tour guides like Mr. Tai have more economic opportunities and conditions.
Not far away, the Moc Chau Heart Tea Hill tourist area of ​​Mr. Hoang Duc Ke's family (63 years old), in sub-area S89, Moc Chau Farm town, groups of tourists are bustling in and out even though they have just entered. active over a year ago. Unlike Vinatea Moc Chau's managed tourism model like Mr. Tai's family, Mr. Ke's tourist tea hill is private. Stemming from his attachment and love for the tea tree and the highland land, Mr. Ke has long cherished a plan to do tea tourism. He confided: “I have lived here for more than 40 years. Tea hill is my love for tea trees and Moc Chau. This land nourishes me and gives me jobs. Agriculture combined with tourism not only brings high economic efficiency, but also brings joy to visitors and myself." Mr. Ke added that in addition to taking photos, tea leaves will be harvested in season, processed and sold to tourists.
Integrating tourism with agriculture also opens up many types of business and job opportunities. From this starting point, Mr. Tai's family, Mr. Ke's family and many other families combined to operate motels, restaurants, and transportation services...
Coming with his family to visit Moc Chau Heart Tea Hill (sub-area S89, Moc Chau Farm town), Mr. Nguyen Ngoc Tien (34 years old), living in Cau Giay district, Hanoi city, was surprised by the development. development of the homeland after many years of working away. Born and raised in this land, Mr. Tien has many memories with tea trees: "Before, there were no houses or beautiful asphalt roads like this around here. Now it is more spacious and new but still retains the inherent beauty of the tea fields. I brought the children in my family to visit, both to have a practical experience and to let them know how big tea leaves feed their parents," he confided.
The “hole” has not been filled
Not only Moc Chau tea, the tourism-agriculture model is a common development trend of other tea growing regions across the country. This is an opportunity for Moc Chau tea hill to promote its landscape advantages, but it is also a big challenge for this young tourist land.
If you want tourism to develop, communication is an indispensable factor, especially in the current digital technology age. Mr. Hoang Duc Ke's Moc Chau Heart Tea Hill tourist area has no plans to promote: "My family is spontaneous, with zero experience. I am a farmer, I only know how to grow crops and raise animals. The number of customers coming now is thanks to word of mouth. This person comes and sees the beauty and tells others," he said.
"Local people are tourism ambassadors, bringing the most unique things of their locality to tourists from near and far," said tour guide and content developer on Moc Chau tourism, Nguyen Duc Linh.
Not unlike Mr. Ke's family, Mr. Nguyen Van Tai's tourism kiosk at Tea Village 69 is advertised but not very effective. In recent years, Ms. Nguyen Thuy Hang (30 years old), Mr. Tai's daughter, has regularly posted articles about tea hill tourism on social networks and groups introducing Moc Chau tourism. Thanks to that, we can "pull" more customers, especially young people, but not many. “I update social networks regularly, posting photos and articles about travel in travel groups. Many times, they advise on trips, destinations, and car reservations for customers. Posting like this will attract more groups of customers, especially young people, but not many," she shared.
Born and raised in the green tea buds, Mr. Nguyen Duc Linh (28 years old), tour guide, content creator about Moc Chau tourism said: "Moc Chau tourism has just developed, so there is still Many limitations, especially in the awareness of local people, propaganda and promotion and orientation for people to work in tourism and agriculture are still weak.
More and more tourism-agriculture models are being born. In addition to tea hills, pine forests, flower valleys, fruit gardens... are destinations chosen by many tourists. Considered a characteristic of Moc land, tea tourism has not really innovated before the rapid development in the general level of Moc Chau tourism. The couple Thu Thao - Nguyen Hieu (28 years old), a tourist to Moc Chau Heart Tea Hill, said: "I find the price reasonable, Moc Chau people are enthusiastic and friendly, the scenery is more beautiful than the pictures. I looked online but the tea hill didn't have anything outstanding. On a scale of 10, I rate it 7 points," Hieu said.

Now, means of transportation to the highlands and accommodation are no longer so rare. If you don't go on a tour, just take the time to research and book in advance, everyone can experience it for themselves. From Hanoi, a journey of about two days and three nights is suitable for busy people who still want to "check-in" nearly all the famous beautiful places of the golden season of Mu Cang Chai.
Interestingly, in recent years, around September and October, rustic homestays are always full before hotels. Regarding food, visitors do not need to worry too much because most roadside restaurants serve fresh and delicious food at uniform prices.
Mam Xoi Hill is a folk name based on the unique round shape of a field located on a high mountain in La Pan Tan commune, about 8 km from the district center. People say that anyone who comes to the "Land of the Blind" without going to Mam Xoi is considered to have not arrived. It's just a funny way of saying it, but Mam Xoi Hill has become a symbol of Yen Bai golden season tourism in particular, and Northwest tourism in general. At an altitude of about 1,100 m above sea level, the air here is always cool. The golden autumn sun is like pouring honey onto each golden rice terrace, connecting buckets between mountains. Blackberry is in the middle, round, like a raspberry and also like a gem. To have this scenic terraced field, the H'Mong people in Ta Chi Lu village had to spend decades persistently reclaiming, breaking the land, weeding, watering, planting, and cultivating. Now the fields not only yield rice but also bring in significant revenue from tourism services such as motorbike taxis, national costume rental, and dining.
During the season, every weekend there are several thousand visitors coming here to visit. Warm sunshine, fragrant rice, children laughing on the hillside, that picturesque scene creates an irresistible attraction for many domestic and foreign tourists.

Through this dish, we can also know why the hearts of the Central Highlands people are so generous: generous like the sun, liberal like the wind, salty like salt and honest like the bitter taste of eggplant. That's because the Central Highlands people chose the bitter taste of eggplant, the spicy taste of chili, and the salty taste of salt to create a dish suitable for minimum living conditions. The combination of three flavors - spicy, bitter and salty - not only helps the dish become more flavorful and stimulates the taste buds, but also increases the body's resistance, helping the body become firm and supple to fight against the cold. cold air in the forest.
In the past, people in the Central Highlands often prepared bitter eggplants, pounded and salted, at home early in the morning and then brought them to the fields to prepare for dinner in the fields, or stored them up for long days in the forest. People choose young eggplants and wash them with water until clean. The same goes for chili peppers, they must be green chili peppers, not yet ripe for redness. After draining the bitter tomatoes, place them on a cutting board and use a large knife to crush each fruit. Crush green chili and salt separately in a rice bowl. Look for the chili to be crushed in salt, then mix it with bitter eggplant, then add a little MSG. Continue using the pestle to gently pound the mixture of salt, chili, eggplant and MSG. The dish is complete when chili, eggplant, salt and MSG form a mixture, blending the bitter, spicy, sweet, salty flavors... To increase the deliciousness of the bitter eggplant dish with crushed salt, people also add more juice. a little juice from a ripe wild lemon.
Bitter tomatoes are also used by the Central Highlands people to prepare other unique dishes such as: bitter tomatoes braised with frogs, bitter tomatoes braised with eels, bitter tomatoes braised with dried fish, bitter tomatoes cooked with buffalo skin, bitter tomatoes cooked with porcupine meat, bitter tomatoes cooked with porcupine meat, bitter tomatoes cooked with dried fish. Shrimp... At first, diners who are not native to the Central Highlands may be uncomfortable, but once they get used to it, it's hard to resist the flavor. At that time, the bitter taste of eggplant, mixed with the spicy taste of chili, and the salty taste of salt became a part of memory, an unforgettable aftertaste. The dish of bitter eggplant pounded with salt will touch the diners' senses very deeply, just like the weather of the sun and wind in this highland region!

From Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, moving to Chiang Mai is as convenient and easy as many other cities in Southeast Asia. This season is considered low season, so I "hunted" for plane tickets and hotel rooms at very reasonable prices. The first impression of Chiang Mai is its similarity to the northwest region of Vietnam with green mountains and forests, fresh and quiet air, very few high-rise buildings but instead small villages with unique architecture. .
It rains almost every day, but it doesn't rain continuously, it only stops for a while. Chiang Mai has a rich history with many unique religious and cultural relics, but I decided to visit another time. And when the rain makes nature come alive, it's better to find activities to immerse yourself in the wonderful natural world. First, Doi Inthanon National Park is a journey worth spending at least a day on. Trekking along the trail, along with many other international tourists, I freely "forest bathed" and admired flowers, birds and beautiful waterfalls. The second day, I "hide" from the rain at Chiang Mai Zoo and Aquarium, which preserves and introduces thousands of species of wild animals on land and in water, and even has a separate area for fish. aquatic life of the Mekong River.
When you're exhausted, it's ideal to visit a local spa with high ratings online to enjoy relaxation from the traditional health care art of indigenous people. And yet, Chiang Mai also has countless beautiful and impressive eco-cafes, even amid the sound of falling rain and the mist of steam. Painting exhibitions, pottery workshops, baking classes... are still held regularly, leading visitors from one discovery to another. Once in Chiang Mai, I fell in love with such "green" tourism models, and then always looked forward to returning.

From the center of the island commune, along the concrete road are small houses hidden under coconut trees leaning towards the sea, next to them are several basket boats lying "resting" on the white sand beach after hours of labor. tired with the fishermen. Coming here, visitors will enjoy the quiet blue sky and sea of ​​a fishing village without being bothered by anyone. Only the wind, sea, sky, small houses, scenes and people blend and connect, creating a beautiful, peaceful picture.
Through the rows of small houses, slowly climbing the mountain step by step, visitors will reach the lighthouse built during the French colonial period. With a height of 119 m, the lighthouse is not only associated with the history of Nhon Chau island commune but also the faith, pride and living ideals of many generations of people here.
Coming to the island, in addition to admiring the beautiful scenery of the sky and water, visitors can also enjoy many fresh seafood dishes such as snails, mackerel, snakehead fish and the most delicious is jumping squid. Swimming in the sea, having dinner and then in the evening watching the moonlight rising behind the mountain top along with the magical light of the lighthouse in the distance is an interesting experience on weekends. The impressive thing about Cu Lao Xanh is that visitors can camp overnight on the beach. Amidst the vast sea and sky, surrounding your hut are only cool breezes, the sound of waves crashing offshore and a sky full of sparkling stars. Then at dawn, the first rays of sunlight rising from the sea wake guests up to welcome a brilliant yet equally romantic new day.
Cu Lao Xanh Island is beautiful, but tourists should not come here from October to January of the following year because this is the time affected by the northeast monsoon, heavy rain, big waves, and rough seas. If you want to experience the unique festive atmosphere imbued with the cultural beliefs of the islanders, you should come in the third lunar month, which is the time of the Fishing Festival.

Quat Dong village is about 25 km south of Hanoi center, equivalent to one hour by bus or motorbike. Following National Highway 1A, we gradually moved away from the streets, passing through lush green rice fields, until we saw shops on both sides of the road lined with embroidery shops, ao dai... and knew where we were going. Walking leisurely into the village, the first stop for all visitors is the temple of embroidery founder Le Cong Hanh.
In contrast to the bustle of the exhibition and shopping areas outside, in Quat Dong village there are many traditional houses that look ancient and peaceful. Interspersed with rice fields and vegetable gardens are fish ponds, village wells, banyan trees, pagoda yards... typical of the Northern countryside for generations. There, people are diligent in farming and raising livestock, while children on summer vacation innocently play soccer, go fishing, or help their parents with housework. Scattered throughout the village are small embroidery workshops, where artisans use their hands to "embroider flowers and weave brocade" on fabric frames. Outstanding products of the village include parallel sentences, parasols, flags, tents, traditional stage costumes, curtains, carpets, portrait paintings, landscape paintings... Uniquely, not only Quat Dong women but also men are also skilled in embroidery, many men have become famous designers and artisans. They also enthusiastically invited us and a few other tourists to sit down and try to learn some basic embroidery techniques. Even though it's not easy to just get used to needle and thread, it's very fun and interesting.
More than 300 years have gone through ups and downs, but recently the market's trend of loving handmade products and craft village cultural tourism models have added vitality to Quat Dong embroidery village. The trip gave us a lot of knowledge and emotions about embroidery. Besides, you can bring home beautiful photos and small souvenirs containing the essence and pride of a fine tradition.

Located in the heart of Bandar Seri Begawan, along the Brunei River, Kampong Ayer is a special living space that the people of Brunei have maintained for more than 1,000 years. Today, despite its large scale like a "floating city" with more than 4,000 houses, hospitals, schools, police stations, markets and mosques built on the water, the people of Brunei still familiar like a big village.
In Kampong Ayer, the most popular means of transportation is by sampan called perahu tambang, also known as water taxi. Thanks to the water taxi, the journey to explore the village becomes easier to reach small destinations in the village or go deeper to the end of the river to explore the vast primeval forests. At work, school or after work, the river is also crowded with people. That's why, in the introduction to the village's history at the Kampong Ayer Culture and Tourism Gallery, this place is likened to the "Venice of the East".
The journey that easily makes visitors "lost" in Kampong Ayer is the walking path along the wooden bridge system connecting the villages, nearly 40 km long, connecting 13 villages together. Most of the houses in Kampong Ayer keep traditional architecture with the main material being wood, from a system of wooden columns over 2 meters high to firmly support the water surface, walls to floors. But not all keep the deep brown color. Many families have gone out of their way to use vibrant tropical paint colors and take care of balconies filled with flowers as a highlight for the space.
The peace in Kampong Ayer can be seen from the moment you step into the house, right on the large balcony with a chair placed by the homeowner to admire the scenery, and a few baskets of flowers to catch the wind. Coming here, visitors will feel the private, hospitable and friendly life of the people of the oil kingdom. They will continue with you on the journey to discover Kampong Ayer with stories of history, culture, costumes, traditional cuisine... to feel pride in their homeland and country.

For a long time, Vinh Son land has been considered the "Da Lat of Binh Dinh" because of its temperate climate and many beautiful landscapes. Located on a high mountain, nearly 800 m above sea level, Vinh Son has its own unique, pristine beauty. In particular, this place has the rather strange Ta Kon ancient citadel.
The stone citadel is located in the forest, nearly 4 km from the main road, the entrance is through a barrier controlled by the ranger station. The entrance road is quite small, with many signs pointing at dangerous places because the small road is as tricky as a slithering snake, passing this corner and turning that corner, not to mention the erratic uphill and downhill slopes.
Those who have never set foot here will probably think that this is the remains of an ancient stone citadel, but perhaps the word "citadel" here has a different meaning. In the language of the Ba Na people, "Ta Kon" means "overlapping each other", meaning the rocks overlap in a mysterious way that is difficult to explain. Indeed, here there are prismatic rocks overlapping each other, stretching for more than a hundred meters, sloping along the mountainside. Individual large rocks stacked on top of each other like giant pillars. Looking at the majestic stone wall in the middle of the jungle, re-envisioning the battles to protect the territory of the ancient Ba Na people that may have happened here, now everything is submerged in silence and moss in the middle of the mountains and forests. . It seems like that, but in fact these are rocks formed by tectonic changes millions of years ago. Hexagonal and cylindrical stone blocks are stacked next to each other, creating a towering wall, standing majestically in the middle of the great Vinh Son.
Ta Kon citadel went into epics and became legendary among the residents of Ba Na Kriem. Legend has it that the Ta Kon citadel area was once the base of the Tay Son insurgent army from the early days of the uprising. Today, Ta Kon citadel was classified as a relic by the People's Committee of Binh Dinh province on December 25, 2013.

Tam Hai island commune belongs to Nui Thanh district (Quang Nam), 30km from Tam Ky center, 12km from Tam Thanh mural village. Bordering the sea on three sides, one side facing the Truong Giang River, it is an island commune but close to the shore so it follows the regulations of a long-term beach. Whether the land is good for tourism development is difficult to say, but Tam Hai is certainly an interesting place. From Tam Hai ferry terminal, step on the boat for 2,000 VND/person, 5,000 VND/motorbike, it only takes about three minutes to get to the island. The amount of change is surprising in urban areas. The first impression of the island is coconut. Every island has coconuts, but many coconuts like Tam Hai is also a unique feature. The island has one road, just keep going around and you will meet each other.
Through the row of houses, to the west of the island is Ban Than rock beach. I don't know if the person who named the rocky beach was inspired by Ban Than beach in "Phu Bien Tap Luc", but entering here is like entering a stone formation. It is a rocky beach that is half submerged and half floating in the sea, stretching about one kilometer. As you keep walking, the rock shapes are different from time to time, some are like walls, some are like seashells, some are like clouds and waves... From Ban Than, you can take a boat to explore Hon Mang and Hon Dua beaches, watching reefs under clear sea water.
Tam Hai fishing village is not too bustling, everything is calm and peaceful. Mrs. Hai, who owns a restaurant near the sea, said there are few customers here because Tam Hai sand is not white because it is located at the river mouth, so it has a characteristic yellow color. But in return, Tam Hai seafood is fresh and delicious, prepared in the true fishermen's style, not fussy, but rich. That day she prepared fish dishes. A little water to cook the pineapple pieces, salty fish sauce, boil, put the blue bone fish in, but how sweet it is! Add steamed squid, that's enough for a lunch. Ms. Hai said Tam Hai people eat simply, but it retains the taste of each seafood species. The small island is suitable for healing vacations, or those who want to live slowly and find inspiration when they are tired of the urban rush.

When the sun just rose, Hai Hoa sea gradually became covered with a brilliant yellow color. The waves rushing towards the shore were overwhelmed by the laughter and calls of tourists who got up early to welcome the dawn. Along the coastal road or under the long stretches of fine sand, people sunbathe, play, swim... The fresh air and the water warming up thanks to the rising sun bring positive energy. to start a journey to explore the heaven and country of Thanh Hoa.
Compared to many other localities, the beaches in the south of Thanh Hoa province such as Hai Hoa, Hai Linh, Hai Thanh, Bai Dong are all newly "awakened" destinations. Thanks to that, these lands always remain peaceful, not too crowded or noisy even during peak season. Right in Hai Hoa, just go a little far from the center and visitors can find nature, where there is only blue sea, golden sand, and whispering casuarina trees on the shore, where everyone can relax. Relax and admire Hon Me Island in the distance while inhaling the characteristic salty ocean flavor in front of you.
Befriending the sea are mountains, rocky outcrops and undulating rocky beaches, adding a wild look to the already charming scene. Many beaches here are blocked at both ends by small mountains. For young tourists, the most interesting photo spot is the Sun Rock. Coming to Dragon Rock beach, the rocks become a resting place to watch the sunset and watch the boats slowly return to shore. East Beach has its own majestic look when the undulating rocky rapids reach out to the coast, welcoming the silvery waves. Or at Lach Bang temple, right at the foot of the temple, there is also a natural rock beach right at the foot of the mountain, where people can wander around catching crabs and looking for small fish.
The attraction of the coastal land of Thanh Hoa is also the rusticity of long-standing fishing villages, traditional markets with stalls selling local specialties or the traditional Do Xuyen - Ba Lang fish sauce craft village full of flavor. fish and shrimp, bringing the scent of the salty sea into every house and street.

Chanh Loc village is the concentrated lotus growing area of ​​Duy Son commune with many lotus fields scattered and interspersed, of which the largest and most famous is the Tra Ly - Dong Lon lotus field. The lotus growing profession has been established and developed for three decades, but in the past 5 years, tourism has only touched and added value to the lotus flowers here. Unlike many places where lotus plants are grown on lakes or swamps, Tra Ly lotus is a lotus variety that lives on dry fields, so you can easily walk around and admire the flowers on many small paths.

It's even more poetic when this time many young people come to check-in wearing ao dai and conical hats, capturing frames with pure Vietnamese beauty. Most Tra Ly lotus flowers are bright pink lotus, standing out against the background of lush green leaves. According to the experience of the farmers, there are two best times to visit lotus fields: morning before 9 o'clock and late afternoon, you should avoid noon with the harsh summer sun.
In addition to lotus, this area also has many rustic old houses, lush fields and gardens, green lawns next to small streams... attracting tourists who love nature and peaceful rural scenery.

At exactly 5 a.m., I and a few other guests were awakened and guided out to the street to welcome the group of monks. From early morning, a large number of local people and tourists were ready, because this is a typical cultural feature of Laos, attracting people from other countries to learn and experience. In the gradually brightening light of dawn, people carefully spread mats on the sidewalk, preparing offerings including sticky rice, cakes, filtered water, and fruit. Most people wear a large brocade cloth across their shoulders, called "pha-bieng". They lined up quietly, knelt down and waited. Tourists like us were told to sit on low chairs to observe and take photos, but absolutely do not turn on the flash or start conversations with the monks.
Very quickly, around 5:30 a.m., a group of monks wearing yellow robes and bare feet spread out into small groups into the neighborhoods. They walked silently, gently accepting food offerings from Buddhists and reciting a short prayer for blessings. In Laos, Theravada Buddhism prevails and according to its teachings, begging for alms helps practitioners eliminate greed, anger and ignorance, as well as bringing blessings to those who give alms. Therefore, Buddhists only worship with cooked food, with an amount just enough for one meal. Joining the crowd, I also respectfully bowed my head and placed my offerings in the monk's bowl. And even though I'm not a Buddhist, I still feel a moment of connection when I make offerings with my own hands like the locals. After the ceremony, the remaining sticky rice will be attached to the fence around the house so that the birds can eat, a small but very humane and friendly deed of the local people.
I had a great start to the morning. This added more inspiration and energy to continue exploring this beautiful, peaceful riverside city that day with landmarks such as the ancient temple complex of Wat Phou, seeing the golden Buddha statue of Wat Phousalou, and reaching the plateau. Bolaven often shops at Pakse market with a few souvenirs to bring back.

One early summer morning, our group of tourists rode motorbikes towards Loc Thuy commune (Phu Loc district, Thua Thien Hue). After more than an hour of traveling, passing through the immense cajuput forest is the first stop: Thuy Yen lake.
Right at Thuy Yen Lake, our group and many tourists were instructed to board a boat to transfer back inside. The view from Thuy Yen lake to the peaceful, cool Tien stream is surrounded by mountains and forests and cool, clear water.
After landing, in addition to choosing to continue by boat, you can walk straight to the stream. Travel time by road also takes about an hour but in return you will have an interesting perspective from above. Looking from a stream in the highest area, you will see a system of streams and waterfalls flowing from top to bottom like a silk strip winding around the mountains and forests. Embracing those streams and waterfalls is a mountain and forest ecosystem with a green carpet of trees and fresh air.
Explaining the name Suoi Tien, people in the area said that since ancient times, people have told each other about a type of flower vine growing on the banks of the stream. Under the sunlight, the flowers bloom beautifully, looking from a distance like the image of a fairy descending to earth. Now that type of flower no longer exists, but when standing in front of the cool waterfall and majestic scenery, many people cannot help but be overwhelmed. “I have been to many stream systems and waterfalls at the foot of Bach Ma mountain, but this is the first time I have set foot on Tien stream. Although traveling by road, waterway and climbing is quite tiring, the scenery here is worth the effort," Mr. Nguyen Vu (Da Nang) admired.
Our favorite experience is sitting on the field huts next to the stream to both rest and cool off. Not only the beautiful scenery, you can also enjoy delicious dishes prepared by people in the area. It could be eel hotpot, grilled chicken, rice balls... or some fish dishes caught right at the stream.
The wildness has created the Suoi Tien brand. Those who have been there will find it hard to forget a place located at the foot of the majestic Bach Ma range in the south of Hue.

Previously, Bai Xep was an isolated fishing village, little known, people mainly lived by fishing. In front of the vast ocean, surrounded by rolling hills and mountains, Bai Xep is nestled under cool green coconut groves and narrow, colorful roads that make visitors come here feel like they are lost in a maze. Therefore, it is no coincidence that Bai Xep was voted by Business Insider magazine as one of the "mysterious pearls" of Asia.
Although it was formed hundreds of years ago and is currently one of the oldest fishing villages in Binh Dinh province, there are only a few dozen households with about 100 people living here. Perhaps thanks to that, this fishing village still retains its wild, peaceful beauty but has an unusual appeal. The lives of the people of the fishing village are not hustle and bustle, not noisy, just quietly next to the natural rocks rising to the surface of the water, where young people like to climb out to "live virtually".
Coming to Bai Xep, visitors will not only be immersed in the pristine natural scenery but also have the opportunity to immerse themselves in the simple, rustic life of the fishermen. The people are very friendly and hospitable, so whether you sit and chat with adults or play with adorable children, you will somewhat understand more about their culture and daily life. In recent years, many coastal roads have opened, Bai Xep has been chosen by many tourists as a tourist and resort destination and has gradually become one of the interesting destinations of Quy Nhon tours. From May to August every year is considered the most ideal time to explore this sea. At this time, the weather is beautiful and sunny, the sea water is clear and peaceful, and the waves are gentle, very suitable for fun swimming activities. If traveling after September, visitors need to consider because the central region often has rain and storms at this time.

To get to K50 waterfall, you can go from Gia Lai or Binh Dinh because the waterfall is located in the border area of ​​these two provinces. We chose to fly to Pleiku city and then travel 150km to K'Bang district, starting from the gate of Kon Chu Rang nature reserve. It is known that no matter which route you take, whether self-sufficient or on a tour, visitors need to register information with the forest ranger unit managing the area.
The first 15km of walking through the forest is not too strenuous or bumpy. The trail was well established, with only a few steep slopes or bushes. After resting and having lunch, the whole group entered the 5km which was much more difficult with climbing passes and wading streams, sweat soaking their shirts. Until they heard the roar of the stream and felt the cool steamy air, everyone became more enthusiastic and walked faster. Even more than the shimmering images on the internet, K50 waterfall appears majestic and spectacular, spanning an entire cliff to form a giant "wall" of pure white water. In the middle of the dense primeval forest, on rough rocks, the water flows down to form a clear blue lake reflecting the clouds and sky. The scenery is both wild and poetic, making us agree with someone who compared this tourist destination to a "fairy".
The tour guide said that the waterfall is called Hang En because behind there is a cave with tens of thousands of swallows living. The name K50 probably comes from the height of the waterfall: about 50m from the top. After camping on a flat ground near the foot of the waterfall, we enjoyed immersing ourselves in nature by swimming, taking photos, walking... Dinner was a real party with local specialties such as bamboo-tube rice, Water chicken, beef in the sun dipped in salt and yellow ants. The sound of the rushing, resounding waterfall is like that, but when you get used to it, it becomes unusually quiet, putting travelers into a sound sleep.
The next day, we participated in the rope swing challenge to explore a corner of the mountain cave behind the waterfall and then returned. Another group went SUP on the Con River, the remaining group continued trekking into the village of Ba Na people, all experiences sounded interesting and exciting.
