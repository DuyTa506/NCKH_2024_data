Huong Tich Pagoda

Huong Tich Pagoda is located on the Hong Linh mountain range, in Thien Loc commune, Can Loc district, Ha Tinh province, known as "Hoan Chau's first scenic spot", an ancient pagoda ranked as a level relic. It is a national and attractive cultural and spiritual tourism destination, attracting more than 150,000 tourists from all over the world every year to worship and worship Buddha.

Huong Tich captivates people's hearts not only because of its rare beauty, but it also attracts many tourists because it is a sacred Buddha land associated with the story of Princess Dieu Thien cultivating and transforming into Buddha. Legend has it that: "About 500 BC, King Trang Vuong of So (China) gave birth to three daughters. When they grew up, the two sisters followed their father's wishes and got married to become officials in the court. In turn, the youngest princess Dieu Thien, the king forced her to marry a military mandarin, who was a cruel and cruel man. She was frustrated and went to Buddha's door to practice. The military officer set fire to the temple, but Dieu Thien and the monks and nuns were protected and saved by Buddha. Going south, Dieu Thien stopped at Huong Tich cave, Thuu Linh mountain (ie Hong Linh), where Viet Thuong built a hermitage to practice and was famous as a compassionate and charitable nun. At that time, So Trang Vuong fell seriously ill, the doctor advised him to have the eyeballs and hands of a girl willingly donated to save him. When he heard the story, Dieu Thien felt compassion and joy to save sentient beings, gouged out his eyes and cut off his hands to give to the messenger to save his father. Vuong Trang recovered from his illness and sent someone to repay the favor, only to find out that it was his daughter. The Buddha was touched by Dieu Thien's heart so he magically restored her eyes and her hands to grow back like before. Dieu Thien attained enlightenment and transformed into Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara with a thousand eyes and a thousand hands." According to historical records as well as through archaeological excavation research and the opinions of some scholars, Huong Tich Pagoda on Hong Linh Mountain is the original pagoda, built during the Tran Dynasty, 13th century and Huong Pagoda in Ha Tay. old (now Hanoi) is a meaningful "version". According to the book Huong Son Thien Tru Thien Pha, a monk was ordered by Lord Trinh to determine the location and build Huong Pagoda in Hanoi during the reign of Le Huy Tong under the reign of Chinh Hoa (1680-1704). Explaining this problem, Mr. Bui Van Nguyen - former General Secretary of the Vietnam VNDG Association said that during the Le - Trinh period, the Le - Lord Trinh kings mostly had hometowns in the Qing country (book Hoang Le Nhat Thong Chi - Ngo Gia Van Phai) so most of the concubines and beautiful women were selected from the Hoan Chau region. Every year, the concubines and beauties of Thanh - Nghe An often go to the Perfume Pagoda festival on Hong Linh mountain on the 18th day of the second lunar month by waterway through Hoi Thong gate (near Cua Lo now). Every time the "beauties" went so far, Lord Trinh was very confused, so the Lord determined a location in the mountainous region of Ha Son Binh to build a second Huong Tich pagoda to worship and let the "beauties" go. Come closer to the festival. Thus, thanks to Lord Trinh's initiative, Vietnam has two Huong Tich pagodas. The scenery and architecture of Huong Tich Pagoda recorded in the 17th and 19th centuries are no longer intact as before because there were many fires here. In the year of At Dau (1885), the pagoda burned down. In the year of Tan Suu (1901), the Governor of An Tinh, Dao Tan, called on the people to rebuild the pagoda. In 2003, the pagoda continued to be restored and rebuilt on a higher, more solid foundation. The Huong Tich Pagoda relic complex includes many items. From the foot of the mountain to the main pagoda there is a distance of nearly 3km. On the journey to Buddhahood, visitors will pass many relics such as Tang Dynasty Lake, Mieu Co, Flea Market, Tam Bao Tien Duong, Am Dieu Thien and King Trang Foundation... Co Temple is where Princess Dieu Thien once passed by. She saw flat rocks so she sat down to rest to enjoy the scenery. Later generations built a temple to worship her.

Tham Vang Cave



From Dien Bien to Muong Ang, where there is a system of limestone mountains scattered throughout the valley in the fields of Xuan Lao commune, and also where there is a deep cave called Tham Vang, it takes at least three hours by car. In the cave exploration tourist map, Tham Vang cave is a brand new name, unfamiliar even to indigenous people around Xuan Lao and Muong Ang areas. According to local people's description, Tham Vang is a cave in the limestone mountain system, with a door opening out halfway up the mountain, chosen as the entrance, from there it goes down to the depths, snaking through small niches and niches. Dangerously narrow and catches the Nam Hua stream, which flows around the field through the villages of Chieng Xom, Pha Hun, Mon Ha, Chieng Lao... In the local Thai language, Tham means "cave", and Bang or Vang means "cave". cancel". In the past, residents around the area, when the couple's life was not good and the soup was not sweet, the husband left for the forest, using Tham Vang cave as a place to hide for the days of... sulking. Therefore, people use the meaning of husband and wife leaving each other to name Tham Vang cave. Due to its not so good meaning, combined with the difficult road to the cave, indigenous people rarely visit this cave, because it is easy to misunderstand that there is something wrong with their family, so they leave home to go to the cave. During the rainy season, a trip to a forest cave is probably not as ideal as a normal walk, but it's okay. The day we arrived at Tham Vang cave, the entire valley at the foot of the mountain was deserted, without a trace of people. The trail connects to the foot of the mountain, only enough for one person to walk. The rains in the forest leave behind mud and slippery soil. We walked endlessly to the foot of the mountain, arriving at a lush green coffee field. Luckily, we met the land owner Phan Nhat. Hearing about the cave trip, Nhat enthusiastically became a guide. The luggage he brought with him was a field knife and a nervous state of mind for visitors from far away, because just after leaving the coffee fields, there was no road at that time, grass, trees, and rotting leaves covered the road. The journey to Tham Vang has another obsession with the Hai leaf. Luckily, this "delicious food" has been encountered in the cave area of ​​Phong Nha - Ke Bang, so we know how to avoid it. On the outside, Ms. Hai looks sparkling and green, one side is covered with pure white fluff, the other side is beautiful and gentle green, as big as a spread hand, growing all over the path. The forester accidentally brushed it, then oh well, the pain was like burning fire, the wound was only slightly red at first, then the itch came rushing back, the more I scratched and rubbed it, the more it spread, followed by a burning feeling. It's terrible, it takes a couple of days to heal. Besides the killer Hai, the road to Tham Vang also had mosquitoes as large as the Nguyen army. The climb was exhausting, but no one dared to stop for fear of becoming a target for the mosquitoes to hold a banquet. After walking for a long time, the vast cave entrance also opened in front of us. Thanks to the dry cave entrance, the layers of stalactites and limestone were weathered and covered with moss, creating a mysterious appearance. Mounted on the dome of the cave, about 50 meters high, are nearly a dozen hives of honey bees (a type of honey bee), laden with honey, shaking every time the wind blows. Phan Nhat said that every season when bees are soaked in honey, Thai people in the valley will bring bamboo trees and install them on mountain rocks to follow the cliffs to get honey for use. Looking at the steep cliff, on which there are still bamboo sticks left from the previous honey collection season, I really do not dare to imagine the job of exchanging my life for that bee bet. With the limited means I brought with me, I gradually advanced deeper into the cave, only a hundred meters, all communication with the outside was cut off, even light did not have a chance to penetrate. A dark, gloomy area next to million-year-old stone pillars, connecting from the cave dome to the floor, rugged and mysterious. Guide Phan Nhat said there were only about ten people in the whole area, all of whom were experienced mountaineers capable of going all the way to the cave. Standing from the inside of the cave looking out at Xuan Lao field, I suddenly saw Tham Vang's familiarity with the entrance to Hang En (Quang Binh). Many stratigraphic structures in the cave such as stalactites in terraced fields, sinkholes, geological faults... are similar to the chain of limestone caves in Phong Nha - Ke Bang such as Son Doong, Hang Tien, Hang Tu Lan... Only The other thing is the terrifying silence.

About 50m from the bridge, there is a "pool" of very cool water, shrimp from the Da River flock there to lay eggs. The whole stretch of river is densely packed with shrimp. Every day, people take turns going up there to catch them and eat them.

That day, Chinese experts and workers also came to help us build the bridge. However, in 1968, China had a cultural revolution, and all its experts and workers withdrew home. Fortunately, the item considered to be the most difficult, the cable car, had been pulled, leaving only the finishing stages remaining. But it was not until 1973 that Hang Tom Bridge was inaugurated. That day was truly a big festival for tens of thousands of Northwest people. Thousands of people came from all over to eat, eat rice balls, and walk for several days to see with their own eyes and once cross the dream bridge. Tom Cave is a highlight for the Northwest region. Because of the majestic and wild beauty of Hang Tom Bridge, in recent years, tourists, Westerners as well as ours, have flocked here, especially since the emergence of the backpacking tourism movement.

According to the genealogy and ordination, this is the place of worship of Saint Tam Giang, who was instrumental in helping King Trieu Viet expel the Liang army to save the country in the 6th century. Tam Giang comes from the name that the Vietnamese Feudal dynasties gave to the two men: Tam Giang supreme god. But there are also people who believe that "Tam Giang" originates from the common name of three rivers: Cau River, Thuong River, Duong River - where there are many temples worshiping the two men. Talking about Saint Tam Giang, this is the name that Vietnamese people collectively call the two saints who manifested from Truong Hong and Truong Hat. Truong Hong and Truong Hat were born into a family of five brothers, four boys and one girl. According to the preserved divine genealogy: On the full moon night of January, when she was 18 years old, Tu Nhan dreamed of seeing the Dragon God wrapped around Luc Dau River, after which she became pregnant. After 14 months of pregnancy, she went to the temple to worship Buddha and returned to Cua Cuu, Van Mau village, when she went into labor and gave birth to a bundle of five children. Tu Nhan wholeheartedly takes care of her children's education. No matter how much you study, you will be able to understand the scriptures and history. Every day you diligently read military books and diligently practice martial arts, so you are all proficient in literature and martial arts. In 545, the Liang Dynasty sent troops to invade Vietnam. Ly Nam De had few troops and could not stop the enemy, so he had to give power to general Trieu Quang Phuc, then died in the mountainous Khuat Lao cave (Tam Nong, Phu Tho). Trieu Quang Phuc sent his troops to Da Trach lagoon (Hung Yen) to fight ambushes, and at the same time encouraged the people to find talented people to fight the enemy to help the country. Hearing that there was a plan to raise money, brothers Truong Hong and Truong Hat discussed asking their teacher for orders, using a plan to establish themselves, return to their hometown to recruit soldiers to help the country. The two men arranged the battlefield so that the Luong army could not resist and was completely defeated. Trieu Quang Phuc ascended the throne. Later, Ly Phat Tu (whose family name was Ly Nam De) plotted to usurp the throne of Trieu Quang Phuc, ascending the throne and calling himself Hau Ly Nam De. Knowing that the two brothers Hong and Hat were good at singing, they invited people to become mandarins, but because of their loyalty to the king, they decided to refuse. Angry, Buddhist Ly ordered to arrest them everywhere. To maintain their loyalty to the king, they discussed taking their families down the Cau River and drinking poison to commit suicide.

Vi Thuy betel village

Vietnamese people are familiar with the saying "The betel is the beginning of the story". Even in people's lives, betel and areca nuts have entered into stories and poetry, and have been closely associated with rural life in the most intimate and loving way. That rustic beauty is still preserved in Vi Thuy betel village and has been passed down for many generations.

Vi Thuy betel village is considered the only remaining betel leaf farming village in the Mekong Delta. Vi Thuy betel village is located in Vi Thuy commune, Vi Thuy district, Hau Giang province. This profession has been closely associated with the people for a long time and has become a characteristic feature every time Vi Thuy commune is mentioned. Currently, Vi Thuy district has nearly 40 hectares of betel, of which Vi Thuy commune is considered the "Kingdom of betel leaves" with nearly 200 betel gardens with an area of ​​about 32 hectares. Only in the freshwater region of Vi Thuy along the Hau River is the betel plant grown to be rich in flavor, delicious to eat, plumping the lips and reddening the mouth. Having the opportunity to come here, everyone is impressed by the betel gardens with hundreds, thousands of straight betel stingers, lush green leaves with a hint of shiny gold, looking so beautiful. Vi Thuy betel is a golden betel with a spicy flavor that is loved by many people. After 3-4 months of sowing, the betel vines will begin to produce leaves, picked once every half a month. Normally, traders come to your home to buy betel and transport it to other places to deliver to customers in the Western provinces. To get a betel box (40 leaves), the grower must go through many stages: buying cuttings, choosing a tree to make betel, opening a ditch, planting roots, watering, picking betel and then arranging them into a box called a betel tureen. Arrange the betel leaves into dozens (sometimes 10, sometimes 16 or 20...depending on the place), then arrange them into hundreds and then thousands before handing them over to the trader. Talking about planting methods, Ms. Nguyen Thi Nam, a betel garden owner, said: whenever you see a fat, healthy betel shoot, you pull it and bury it in the loose soil of the betel bed. After a short time, when the betel vines take root, they are extracted and placed on a new stake. Betel is easy to grow, grows very quickly and requires little care. Because it is a leaf-producing type, if there is enough fertilizer and water, betel will be harvested after 3-4 months. In particular, betel nuts prefer green (organic) fertilizers of natural origin, not chemical fertilizers. Using traditional fertilizer (green manure), the betel leaves are slender and have a shiny green color slightly tinged with yellow, which looks more beautiful. Betel growers say that the betel venom must be equal to that of Melaleuca trees, because Melaleuca bark sticks very firmly to the tree trunk, creating conditions for the roots of the betel vines to adhere and grow well. People often harvest betel in the early morning. When it's time to pick the betel, the betel picker will choose the betel leaves that are shiny and just ripe to golden yellow. The remaining leaves will be picked in the next batch about 10 days after the previous batch. Growers also have to build a trellis to pick leaves from high above. When the tops go beyond the trellis, cut them off... Vi Thuy betel is both a traditional cultural feature and serves the needs of many people in daily life and during holidays, weddings... In addition to eating and making offerings during holidays, betel is also a type of betel. medicinal herbs are researched to extract essential oils for application in pharmaceutical and cosmetic production. Recently, Vi Thuy betel nuts are also exported to some Asian countries, bringing significant profits to betel growers.

May God bear witness to my heart. If I'm drowned in water, if I'm wronged, God will let me float up three times." Sure enough, she appeared three times, everyone was scared. After a month, the lord's flower boat returned to take her back to the capital. Knowing about the injustice, Lord Trinh Giang built a temple and an altar to exonerate her. Her temple was visited by King Tu Duc and conferred the title: Dong Nhac De Ba - Lady Trinh. Later generations mourned and admired her loyalty. Many famous people have written poems of praise: From then until now, visitors from all over have flocked to visit Ba De temple.

Tuong Long Tower (also known as Do Son Tower) was built during the reign of Ly Thanh Tong. This Buddhist architectural work was built on a land area of ​​about 2,000 m2, located in Van Son ward, Do Son town. The four corners of the tower all lean to the center 190 degrees. The inside of the tower is hollow and is where the Amitabha statue is placed. The building is built of bricks and stones of different sizes. In addition to bricks, there are also bricks covering the outside of the tower shell with unique decorative arts such as lotus flowers, chrysanthemums, and lemon flowers. This decoration represents typical Ly Dynasty art. According to the book "Dai Viet History", in the year Mau Tuat 1058, King Ly Thanh Tong, after traveling across Ba Lo beach, stopped here to build a tower. Later, he dreamed of a golden dragon and gave the tower the name Tuong Long, meaning "Seeing the golden dragon appear" to remember the good omen. Some people believe that Do Son seaport is one of the cradles that received the tower here to worship Buddha. In the past, this place may have been an observatory in the "transmitting light" system. Whenever there is an incident, coastal observation stations burn dry grass to send smoke into the sky, transmitting alarm signals to the capital. Through the remaining relics, it can be seen that Tuong Long tower was built at the same time as Bao Thien tower in Thang Long citadel (now the Hanoi Opera House area). According to Dai Nam Nhat Thong Chi", the old Do Son tower is 100 meters high, built on a 1000m2 area of ​​land, has 9 floors, the door opens to the west. One meter is 0.45m long, so the tower is about 0.45m high. , located on a mountain 100m above the sea, so this tower was among the highest among towers in Vietnam at that time. Tuong Long Tower was renovated and restored many times during the Tran and Le dynasties, but in In the 3rd Gia Long reign (1804), the Nguyen court demolished the tower to get bricks to build Hai Duong citadel. This proves that the ancient Tuong Long tower was extremely large and majestic. From the location of Tuong Long tower, you can see the sea.

Ngo Mon

Location: Ngo Mon is the main gate to the Imperial Citadel in Hue citadel, City. Hue, Thua Thien - Hue province. Characteristics: Ngo Mon is one of the typical ancient architectural works of the Ngu Huong River mountainous region.

Although it has gone through more than a century and a half with many natural storms and devastating wars, thanks to skillful construction techniques and especially proficient architectural art, Ngo Mon still remains. still stands the test of time to become one of the typical ancient architectural works of the Ngu Song Huong mountain region. Ngo Mon was built in 1833, when King Minh Mang re-planned the ground and perfected the overall architecture in the Citadel. Because the I Ching stipulates that the king should always face the south to rule the world, so, right from the time of Gia Long (1802 - 1810), when building the Hue Capital, architects gave the system The system of citadels and palaces is located in the position of "can tong ton" (northwest, southeast). This direction is also considered the north - south direction. The throne in Thai Hoa Palace is considered the central position of the overall plan, Ngo Mon is located to the south of it. Based on the compass of Eastern feng shui geography, the south belongs to the "noon" direction on the "ty noon" axis (meaning north-south). Therefore, the Minh Mang dynasty named this place. The newly built gate in the middle of the front of the Imperial Citadel is Ngo Mon, replacing the old name Nam Khuyet Dai. We should understand that Ngo Mon is the southern gate with a spatial meaning, not that the word "noon" here has a temporal meaning which is the hour of "noon", when the sun stands in the middle of the day. Therefore, it is impossible Translate the word Ngo Mon into "Noontime gate" as someone has translated it. Only by properly understanding the meaning of the ancients when naming it can we see more clearly the position of Ngo Mon in the overall architecture of the Citadel. In the past, this gate was often closed tightly all year round, only opened when the king entered and left the Imperial Citadel accompanied by a royal delegation, and on occasions when meeting important foreign envoys in the royal palace... However, Ngo Mon Gate It is not just a gate, but a rather complex architectural whole: above there is also the Ngu Phung Floor, which is considered a platform, used to organize a number of annual ceremonies of the court, such as the Royal Court Ceremony. Truyen Lo (reading the names of candidates who passed the doctoral exam), Ban Soc ceremony (distributing calendar), Duyet Binh ceremony... and this is also the place where the abdication ceremony of King Bao Dai took place on August 30, 1945 . In terms of architectural structure, the overall Ngo Mon can be divided into two systems: the platform system below and the Ngu Phung Floor system above, although both have been designed to closely match each other. and in harmony with each other from the whole to the details. Platform system: Nearly 5m high, Ngo Mon platform is built on a perpendicular U-shaped plan, the base is 57.77m long and the wings are 27.06m. The main architectural materials are brick, stone and brass. In the middle of the platform, there are three parallel paths: Ngo Mon (for the king), Ta Giap Mon and Huu Giap Mon (for civil and military mandarins to follow in the Ngu Dao troupe). Inside each U-shaped wing, there is a tunnel-like path that runs from inside to outside, then straight into Dung Dao street. These two paths are called Ta Dich Mon and Huu Dich Mon (for soldiers and elephants and horses accompanying the Ngu Dao group). The upper part of the 5 aisles are all built into high arches, but at the two ends of the 3 middle aisles, the architecture of the Minh Mang period is structured with systems of horizontal and vertical beams made of brass with a cross section of 15x12 to Reinforcing the force from the Ngu Phung Floor located on the platform. Where there is greater weight to bear, the greater the number of crossbeams and the narrower the distance between them, meaning the higher the beam density. And to maintain aesthetics, they have added a layer of laminated copper foil to the outside of these copper beam systems. They have proven to be very proficient in calculating loads and material strengths, as well as in the appropriate use of construction methods and materials. As for the upper floor, the front of the middle house has a louvered door, surrounded by planks, but there are many windows with different shapes: round, fan-shaped, flute-shaped... The roof can be divided into 9 sets. Ngu Phungra Tower is divided into 3 rows, each row consists of 3 roofs: the main row runs horizontally along the U-shaped bottom and two sub-rows run along the two U-shaped wings. These two rows are called Ta Duc Lau and Huu Duc Lau. From the ground level, people go up to the platform by two systems of steps built of clear stone on both sides, located in the open but very discreet. Surrounding the platform is a female wall system (flower wall, railing) decorated with many types of hollow molded flower tiles glazed in five colors. : The Ngu Phung floor has two floors, large at the bottom and small at the top. The ribs are made of ironwood. The floor consists of nine sets of yellow and green glazed tube tile roofs, called royal and lapis lazuli tiles. The tiles are roofed in a yin and yang style. The floor is built on a 1.14m high platform built on a dais. The building has 100 even columns, including 48 columns throughout both floors. The roof of the lower floor is simple, connected together and runs around in a circle on all sides to protect the gables of this floor from sun and rain. But on the upper floor, the roof is divided into 9 different sets, of which the middle set of roofs is higher than the 8 sets of roofs on both sides. All sides of the lower floor are left empty, except for the middle, which has a system of mirrored doors on the front, and built panels on both sides and on the back where the royal seat is set for the king to sit and attend the ceremony. The reason why Ngo Mon overall is built on a U-shaped plan and the Ngu Phung Lau system is divided into 9 sets of roofs, large and small, high and low, undulating and looking fun like that is to avoid the heaviness of the roof. a relatively massive block-shaped architectural work. The platform system is all built of hard materials (stone, brick, copper), but thanks to its soft shape, harmonious arrangement and skillful refinement, it still looks very gentle. The stone is polished smooth, the bricks are carefully fired, and mixed with molasses and tree resin at a high ratio, so the durability is very great. The walkways cut through the base of the platform into quite long tunnels, but natural light still shines in fully thanks to the raised door panels and round windows decorated with the word "tho". The wooden railing systems (on the upper floor of the Ngu Phung Floor) and hollow molded bricks (on the surrounding wall on the platform) further make the overall architecture more elegant. The compartments on the roof, ceiling and gables of the building are decorated with many images of dragons, dragons, bats with money in their mouths, poems, and flowers, making the roof even more beautiful. Based on the measurements of all plan dimensions, elevations and sections, the late artist Pham Dang Tri proved that the whole as well as each part of Ngo Mon architecture is established according to the "golden ratio". of Western aesthetics; although architects in the first half of the 19th century only followed their intuitive aesthetics. On the other hand, the numbers on the Ngo Mon architecture are also applied according to the principles of Eastern Translation, such as number 5, number 9, number 100. The five aisles symbolize the "five elements". The nine rooftops represent the number 9 in the "nine five" moat in the I Ching, corresponding to the destiny of the heavenly son. One hundred house pillars at Ngu Phung Floor show that it is the combined number of "Ha Do" and "Lac Thu" in that book. The number of "Ha Do" is 55 (because the numbers from 1 to 10 add up: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10); The number of "Lac Thu" is 45 (because the numbers 1 to 9 add up: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9). Thus, the number of achievements of Ha Do and Lac Thu combined (55+45) is 100. And when talking about Translation Studies, we must talk about yin and yang, because "One yin and one yang are the virtue of the Way". Ha Do's positive number is 25 (because odd numbers from 1 to 10 add up: 1+3+5+7+9; Ha Do's negative number is 30 (because even numbers from 1 to 10 add up: 2+ 4+6+8+10) and Lac Thu's positive number is 25 (due to the odd numbers from 1 to 9 adding up: 1+3+5+7+9); Lac Thu's negative number is 20 (due to the Even numbers from 1 to 9 add up: 2+4+6+8) The two positive numbers of Ha Do and Lac Thu add up to 50 (ie 25+25); their two negative numbers add up to also be 50 (ie 30 +20). So the yin and yang of Dich Hoc are equal, both 50. That means: (25+25) + (20+30)= 100. In the field, if we use the main road of the Citadel which is Dung In order to divide the floor plan of the Ngu Phung Floor into two parts, we see that each side has 50 symmetrical columns. The yin and yang five elements of Eastern philosophy have been expressed specifically in the Ngo Mon architecture. , in our ancient architectural works, the ancients have entrusted many hidden secrets, hidden words, and very profound meanings. In addition, the emptiness around the lower floors of Ta Duc Lau and Huu Duc Lau clearly reveals The slender columns at Ngu Phung Floor give viewers a feeling, an impression of serenity, gentleness, and comfort. Overall, Ngo Mon Mon is massive and magnificent, looking from a distance like a magnificent castle, but when we approach, we see that the architects of the Minh Mang Dynasty showed very high skills in design and decoration. Therefore, it became a lovely and lovely architectural work, close to the natural landscape and the soul and emotions of the people of Hue. Ngo Mon deserves to be listed among the most outstanding artistic architectural works of the Nguyen Dynasty in particular and of Vietnamese ancient architecture in general. The architectural plan of the Ngu Phung Floor system matches the plan of the platform system, as mentioned above, forming an arm of the owner stretching out in front to welcome guests.


Dong Ba Market

Location: Dong Ba Market is located along the north bank of the Perfume River, on Tran Hung Dao Street, Hue City, about 100m north of Truong Tien Bridge. Characteristics: Dong Ba Market is the largest commercial center of Thua Thien - Hue province and the region.

Before there was Dong Ba market, outside Chanh Dong gate (ie Dong Ba gate according to popular parlance) under Gia Long's reign, there was a large market named "Qui Gia Thi". The name of this market marks the return to Phu Xuan of the Nguyen Dynasty's military officials. During the Quang Toan period, people fled in all directions. At the beginning of the Nguyen Dynasty, there was peace and people returned from everywhere. Qui Gia is the market of those who have returned. Nearly a century later, in the summer of 1885, the capital fell and Qui Gia market was burned by the French invaders. In 1887, King Dong Khanh rebuilt the market and renamed it Dong Ba. The market provides food for palaces, hospitals, military posts, and dormitories of Quoc Hoc, Dong Khanh, Binh Linh, and Thien Huu schools. In 1899, during the process of urban embellishment according to Western style, King Thanh Thai brought the market to where it is now, and the old market hall became the Dong Ba French-Vietnamese school. Dong Ba market during Thanh Thai's time consisted of 4 rows of shops: front, back, right, left.

In the middle of the market there is a square building with three floors. The lower floor has 4 walls, each wall has 2 doors. The upper floor has doors on all 4 sides and clock faces to mark the hour. A stone well was built in the market, with a mechanical system to help draw water. When taking water, you use your hand to turn the machine, and the water in the well naturally overflows and sprays out. In the early 20th century, Dong Ba market was renovated many times but still kept the old style. In 1967, the Saigon government demolished the old market and rebuilt a new one. The unfinished project was bombed and destroyed by American artillery bombs during the 1968 Hue Spring campaign. Then the Saigon government ordered temporary repairs for business purposes. In 1987, Dong Ba market was completely restored.

Tomb of Tu Duc (Khiem Lang)

Location: Tu Duc Tomb is located in Thuy Bieu commune, City. Hue, Thua Thien - Hue province. Characteristics: The mausoleum was built in 1864 and completed in 1867 on an area of ​​475 hectares. Unlike other well-proportioned mausoleums, Tu Duc's mausoleum was built liberally and in harmony with existing nature, reflecting the romantic soul of this poet king.

Tu Duc's Tomb is a masterpiece of poetry, a charming landscape painting, evoking to visitors a "smooth, poetic soul" (une douce rêve). King Tu Duc's mausoleum was built in an extremely difficult historical context for the country and for the king himself. The king was born in 1829 and ascended the throne at the age of 20 (1848). Ten years later, because the Hue court applied a narrow foreign policy, the French colonialists attacked Da Nang (1858) and then invaded Gia Dinh (1859) and a number of other provinces in Cochinchina (1862). King Tu Duc was a person who fully absorbed Eastern culture and philosophy with its internal contradiction between the positive in youth and the negative in old age, between life and death. The more he failed in the affairs of the country as he grew older, the more pessimistic and pessimistic he became. The king thought that death would inevitably come to his life, and in order to ease the torment and suffering in the remaining days of his life, he ordered the construction of a mausoleum as a second royal palace so that he could occasionally come here to spend time. control, rest, and also to make "my castle house" (Vi Ngo Vinh Vu, excerpt from Khiem Cung Ky). Standing in this day and age, looking back at the difficult circumstances of the country at that time, the large and costly architectural scale of the king's mausoleum, and the names Khiem Cung and Khiem Lang used to name it, we see That is also an internal contradiction that is difficult to justify for the king himself. But anyway, after completing the mausoleum, King Tu Duc lived another 16 years, until 1883, at the age of 55. After geographical experts examined the land and selected a location in Duong Xuan Thuong village, King Tu Duc "standardized" the mausoleum's architectural project according to his preferences in October 1864. But we still had to watch the day for good, so it wasn't until December of that year that construction began. The entire architectural work of this mausoleum is expected to take 6 years to complete with 3,000 soldiers and workers, and they will be allowed to return home every 3 months. But the Attorney General of the Ministry of Public Works at that time, Nguyen Van Chat, asked for it to be done within 3 years only. The court appointed him and Marshal Le Van Xa of the Infantry to take care of the construction. Not being allowed to take turns to rest and being forced to increase their labor force to the maximum under minimum conditions, those 3,000 dissatisfied soldiers and workers listened to Doan Trung's call to revolt. On the night of the 16th a.m. On September 17, 1866, they used the guise of worshiping the "Five Great Perfectionists" to return to the capital to overthrow King Tu Duc's throne in order to put Ung Dao, the fifth generation grandson of King Gia Long, on the throne, but when they entered When he reached Thai Hoa Palace, he received a strong reaction from the imperial army, so he failed. The rebellion was completely suppressed. King Tu Duc's accident has passed, but the king's reputation has been damaged a lot, because this was not a foreign invasion, but an uprising right in the heart of the Central court. Among the 13 Nguyen kings, King Tu Duc was the most knowledgeable in Eastern education, especially Confucianism. The king was good at history, philosophy, literature and art, and especially loved poetry. The king left behind 600 essays and 4,000 poems in Chinese and about 100 poems in Nom. The king's poetry reflects a kind person, a sentimental soul, and an art enthusiast. That quality is also clearly shown in the architectural art of the king's mausoleum. History says that the king himself "decided" (decider) the model for its construction. Within La Thanh, which is about 12 hectares wide, nearly 50 large and small architectural works are spread out in clusters on complex terrain about 10 meters higher and lower than each other. But, the staircase system paved with clear stone and the winding paths paved with Bat Trang tiles have connected all the architectural works into a unified, correlated, and close whole. Passing through Khiem Cung Mon, a two-story three-entrance gate built on a high ground, people enter a palace system consisting of several dozen large and small buildings and dependent architectural works. The rows and rows of palaces here were reserved for the king and his entourage of ladies who occasionally came to stay and have fun. Minh Khiem Duong - an ancient theater with decorative architectural and artistic value. Hoa Khiem Palace - the place to worship the emperor and queen, still contains many royal utensils and contemporary works of art. If the houses in Khiem Cung are made of wood, all the architectural works in the tomb area on the other side are built of bricks and stones. Most notable is the largest stele in Vietnam, about 5 meters high, protected by a massive, solid building with big columns, thick walls and rolling doors. The architects built Bi Dinh with such materials and styles to withstand the test of time. On the hill across Tieu Khiem Tri semicircular lake is Buu Thanh built of bricks and in the middle is a small house built of clear stone, where the king rests. The castle is covered by a green pine forest, ringing throughout the four seasons. In addition, the drainage system throughout the mausoleum has been designed and built to a high level, and has very good circulation. In general, each architectural work in Tu Duc tomb carries a different line of visual art: not duplicated and very lively. The way of distributing areas and arranging architectural works in each area at Tu Duc tomb has broken the traditional system of preserving classical symmetry in some other tombs. There are also soft winding paths following the natural land position or shaped by human hands. The architectural lines are generous, in harmony with existing nature, or renovated to suit the art of landscape architecture. If breaking symmetry is also a beauty in art, then Tu Duc mausoleum has that beauty. The architecture and nature here evoke many new aesthetic emotions for visitors, and reflect the romantic and lyrical soul of a poet king. Tu Duc's Tomb is a masterpiece of poetry, a charming landscape painting, evoking to visitors a "smooth, poetic soul" (une douce rêve).

Before parting, the two invited each other to the shore to lament and promise. He promised that spring would come when the cherry blossoms would bring back news of victory. At home, Mai Nuong heard that Hoang Tung had died in battle, so she decided to throw herself beside the stream to drown herself.

A few years after the collapse of the Tay Son dynasty, Gia Long took revenge on those who had contributed to the Tay Son dynasty, so Hoang Tung committed suicide by the lake to be happy with his lover in nine springs.

The K'ho village elders who have long resided in this land said: Once upon a time, the chief of the Joi Bieng mountain region had a very beautiful daughter. Every time the mountain girl sings, the forest leaves stop rustling and the birds stop singing to listen. Her lover is the son of the chief of the neighboring village. He is loved and respected by many people not only because of his muscular physique and handsome face but also because of his bravery and courage that few can match. They exchanged vows to become husband and wife, but the young man had to go out to kill the enemy and many moons passed without him returning. The heartbroken girl went to the deserted mountain where they used to date, singing passionately and sadly in the hope that the person of her dreams would return to her old place. The singing moved the B'ling bird. They invited each other to fly far away to find out the news and then come back to tell her that the boy had died on the battlefield. However, the mountain girl still refused to accept that harsh truth. She kept singing and singing until she was exhausted, collapsed and never got up again. The herd of prostrate elephants, listening to her singing for so long, turned to stone and remained silent. Suddenly there was a loud explosion, the sky and earth shook, causing the mountain to break and a waterfall suddenly flowed, releasing white foam. The murmuring sound of the waterfall mixed with the rustling sound of the forest, the chirping of birds seemed to follow the lyrics, and the sound of the guitar of a beautiful, faithful mountain girl. The K'ho people then named the waterfall Lieng Rowoa Joi Bieng - the waterfall of elephants prostrate and turned to stone before passionate, eternal love. It would be a pity to come to Da Lat - Lam Dong without going to the mysterious and poetic Lieng Rowoa (Elephant Waterfall). This waterfall, associated with the story of a faithful and tragic love, has been recognized as a national scenic spot. The clear water flowing through the granite mountainside looks spectacular, especially when the bright sunlight shines down on the waterfall, creating a rainbow of seven colors.

In the middle of the vastness, there are layers and layers of forest trees that are green or dotted with fiery red leaves, and carpets of bright yellow or purple flowers that are strangely beautiful. At the foot of the waterfall and in the old forest, there are some large rocks shaped like elephants. Therefore, the roaring sound of the waterfall makes people enjoy the feeling of a herd of elephants racing or spraying water to play with each other. Behind the white waterfall that is churning out mist are deep, mysterious caves. It is a Bat cave that goes deep into the ground up to 50m with cliffs of very strange shapes and colors. Tree roots and vines are intertwined, the deeper you go, the darker and colder the cave becomes like a witch's cave. It is Wind Cave with a very narrow entrance but quite spacious inside, with the sound of wind flutes. Besides its charming and poetic beauty, Elephant Falls was once a revolutionary base during the two resistance wars against the French and Americans. Newly renovated into a tourist attraction in recent years, Elephant Falls was quickly recognized as a national cultural and historical relic. An investment project of 20 billion VND to upgrade the Lieng Rowoa landscape in the years 2003 - 2005 was also approved by the local government. However, the most fervent wish that those who love Voi Waterfall remind investors is to be careful and not lose the mysterious wild beauty of Lieng Rowoa mountain girl.

The battlefield took place in present-day Tuy Hoa city. Phu Gia's army was stationed at Nuu Mountain, while Champa's army was stationed at Nhan Mountain to defend themselves. The battle was extremely fierce with no winner or loser. To avoid loss of life and property to the civilians, the two sides agreed to build the tower together. The side that completed it first would win, and the losing side would have to automatically withdraw their troops from Phu Yen. The two locations chosen by both sides were: Cham army on Nhan mountain, Mr. Phu Gia's army on Co Rua mountain, a protruding part of Nuu mountain. The Cham army put all their strength into building day and night until it was almost completed when Mr. Phu Gia's tower was completed, standing tall in a corner of the sky. The Cham army had to accept defeat. After that, Mr. Phu Gia's army challenged Champa to burn the tower. Whichever tower burned first would win and the other side would have to withdraw their troops. Mr. Phu Gia's tower burned down overnight while the tower on Nhan Mountain still stood. Luong Van Chanh brought his army to the foot of Nhan Mountain, forcing the Cham army to withdraw across Ca Pass. During the resistance war against the French (1945 - 1954), when the French colonialists invaded our country, they fired artillery, causing the top of the tower and three corners of the tower to collapse.

The roof of the tower consists of many layers, the top is made of a whole stone slab with an evenly balanced lotus bud shape. That is the Linga symbol of the Cham people.

The main door is in the east direction, the upper part of the door is arched, built in a rolling style, the pillars and crossbeams of the door are soft limestone blocks, easy to carve and carve. Inside the tower, the vertical walls soar from the base of the tower to the end of the body. The higher you go, the smaller the wall becomes until it reaches the top, forming a cone shape.

According to the tower stele recorded, in the year Thuan Thien Nguyen Nien (1010), King Ly Thai To appointed two court officials, Nguyen Dao Thanh and Pham Hat, to design projects and take care of the construction of 8 pagodas, including Vinh Nghiem Pagoda. Nowadays. The pagoda was completed in 1016, the first abbot was Zen Master Van Hanh, followed by Dao An, Minh Tam, Bao Tanh and Hue Quang. In the 13th century, Buddha Emperor Tran Nhan Tong had it repaired, restored, embellished, and renamed Vinh Nghiem Pagoda (Vinh Nghiem Tu) with the hope that the pagoda would forever last and be forever dignified. Vinh Nghiem Pagoda has long been recognized and honored by our people as one of the Buddhist propagation centers of the Truc Lam Yen Tu Zen sect of the Tran dynasty, imbued with national identity, and is the place to organize and establish the model. Unified Buddhism is based on the unification of previous Zen sects and is also the model of the Buddhist Church for later Church organizations. According to historical records, Vinh Nghiem Pagoda is a place where a large number of monks and nuns participated in the summer retreat and a large number of Buddhists came to listen to the Mahayana Dharma. Therefore, the pagoda was built on a large plot of land, and the architectural planning had to ensure the daily life of the people. If during the Ly Dynasty, few people knew about the pagoda, then during the Tran Dynasty, since Tran Nhan Tong officially founded the Truc Lam Yen Tu Zen sect and advocated bringing Buddhism to life, Vinh Nghiem Pagoda functioned as the center. The Zen sect's propaganda has had a wide influence not only in the Zen world but also in many circles, many fields, and many different areas of social life. All three Patriarchs (Tran Nhan Tong, Phap Loa, Huyen Quang) took Vinh Nghiem Pagoda as the center for spreading Buddhism of the Truc Lam Yen Tu Zen sect, which after the Tran dynasty continued to develop according to the flow of history. History of Vietnamese Buddhism. For nearly 800 years, the Truc Lam Yen Tu Zen sect has gone through many events, associated with the ups and downs of Vietnamese history, but is still maintained and developed. From the Vinh Nghiem Buddhist center, the ideology of this Zen sect spread throughout the country and to the region and the world. Vinh Nghiem Pagoda is the most important relic of Vietnamese Buddhism in general, of the Truc Lam Yen Tu Zen sect in particular, considered the first Buddhist University of Vietnam and also considered the ancestral place of Vinh Nghiem. , considered by researchers as the “Museum of Mahayana Buddhist Culture”. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Vinh Nghiem Pagoda was a major printing and publishing center of Vietnamese Buddhism. The woodblock (engraved board) warehouse still kept today (engraved here), still retains 34 books with nearly 3,000 engravings, each copy has two sides, each side has 2 pages (negatives), about 2,000 books. Nom and Chinese characters. This is the only set of original woodblocks of the Truc Lam Buddhist sect currently preserved at Vinh Nghiem pagoda to spread the core ideas of Buddhism to hundreds of pagodas with millions of monks and nuns. Buddhists of the past. With unique scientific and historical values, the Woodblocks of Vinh Nghiem Pagoda were honored by UNESCO as a documentary heritage in the Asia-Pacific region in 2012. Over nearly a millennium with many duplicates. The current architectural work of Vinh Nghiem Pagoda is the product of the Le Trung Hung and Nguyen dynasties. To meet the country's needs for worshiping Buddha and training monks, Vinh Nghiem Pagoda was built on a large scale. The architectural clusters are arranged in a rectangular space, spread along a vertical axis and in order from the South to the North into five main architectural complexes: Tam Quan, Tam Bao, First Ancestor House, Bell tower, Second Ancestral House. Three gates: The three gates of Vinh Nghiem Pagoda are a wooden architectural work built in the overlapping style, including 01 compartment, 02 wings with 02 floors and 08 curved roofs. The roof is built with bricks covered with mortar, the middle is built in the shape of two dragons flanking the moon, the strip is built with bricks plastered with mortar, the bend is shaped like Nghe Chau, the gully is built with bricks covered with mortar connecting the curved ends; The three doors symbolize the three elements of Falsehood - Emptiness - Emptiness of Buddhism, three things that Zen practitioners must master. Passing through this Three Entrances means that you have entered the meditation scene, and you will definitely receive Buddha's salvation to make your heart calm and peaceful. This architectural building was restored in 1993-1994. : Is a complex of three Buddhist worship works according to the Mahayana sect - a sect characterized by worshiping many Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and practitioners, in which, worshiping Bodhisattva statues is a typical feature of the Mahayana sect. With wooden architectural structures including Tien Duong, Thieu Huong and Thuong Dien, these three works form a block, the layout is in the style of the letter "cong" with spacious design, 7-way walkway, leaf blade, 4-way roof. knife, 8 bets, the style of husband and wife, three to three, four to four. The outermost building is the Tien Duong building with 5 compartments and 2 wings; The structure of the rafters is in the form of lines, front and back, and elaborately carved gong prices. Connecting the entire Front Street with the Upper Palace is the Thieu Huong Court with 3 compartments; The truss structure is in a striped pattern. The innermost Upper Palace consists of 3 compartments, also made in a striped pattern, not carved but smooth and firmly sharpened. The Three Jewels Palace holds three treasures of the Zen temple: the Buddha treasure, the Dharma treasure and the Sangha treasure. Buddha said here the statues are kept in noble thrones, worshiped, and burned with incense all year round. Dharma treasures are scriptures that discuss Buddhist affairs. Monks are monks who practice and focus on Buddhist affairs, and are a bridge between Buddha and sentient beings. All three of these things are preserved and preserved by the people with the spirit of only making them more beautiful and better, not taking them away. Everyone keeps in mind that what belongs to the Buddha is one for ten, so if someone accidentally takes it away, they will be tormented and bring it back to make a restitution ceremony, repenting for the rest of their lives. A very special thing to note at the Tam Bao temple is that the rammed earth foundation has been preserved for quite a long time, which is not the case in any ancient Vietnamese pagoda. In Buddhist circles, rammed earth has the meaning of being a material that creates harmony between yin and yang. Entering the Tam Bao Palace, everyone will feel that this place has fresh, cool air that makes the heart more pure. The systematic arrangement of Buddha statues, horizontal panels, couplets, and worship objects has made this place truly solemn, true to the Zen and Buddha scene. Tourists from all over come here to respectfully bow down and light a stick of incense to make offerings to the Buddhas to show their sincerity, and vow to use their own little strength and resources to contribute to building Buddha and Zen scenes. more beautiful days. : This is the place to worship the three patriarchs of the Truc Lam Yen Tu Zen sect, the King - Buddha Tran Nhan Tong, Zen Master Phap Loa and Zen Master Huyen Quang. The floor plan is arranged in the style of the word "cong" with typical architectural features of the Le Trung Hung period (XVIII century), including 3 compartments with 2 wings for the Front Street, 2 compartments with 2 wings for the Front Palace, 2 compartments with 2 wings for the Hau Palace, and a layer of funny nose tiles. according to the 4-roof structure; Although the floor area is not large, it is quite majestic and dignified. The First Ancestor's House is made with wooden roof structures in the style of gong stands and single pillars. There are not many intricately carved patterns, but are mostly smooth, sharp, and knotted. Because of this First Patriarch's building, Vinh Nghiem Pagoda has become an ancient pagoda with the richest architecture of Vietnamese and Buddhist identities that no other ancient pagoda in the Northern region has. In Bac Giang, large-scale pagodas often build ancestral houses behind the Tam Bao temple. But this ancestral house of the pagoda only has a statue worshiping the first ancestor of that pagoda, or the pagoda only has a statue of Bodhidharma to worship, not a statue of the Three Patriarchs of Truc Lam. This is the difference that only exists at Vinh Nghiem Pagoda, not like other pagodas in Bac Giang province in particular and the Northeast region in general. : It is a two-storey structure behind the first Patriarch's house, with "upper autumn, lower summer" architecture in the style of the Nguyen Dynasty (19th century). The upper floor has a wooden floor, in the middle hangs a large bell cast in the 11th year of Minh Mang (1830), where monks invite the bell to propagate Buddhism to the ten directions. This is a beautiful architectural work with angular stripes and a harmonious combination of wood and brick materials. : Located behind the bell tower, the floor plan is in the style of "two", including 11 Bai Duong rooms running parallel to 3 back rooms, connected by a gutter which is the flow of the roof behind the Bai Duong building with Drops flow from the roof in front of the harem. This is a construction of the Le - Nguyen dynasties, where statues, tablets or images worshiping the successors of the three founding fathers of the Truc Lam Yen Tu Zen sect are placed. : Along both sides of the buildings mentioned above are two corridors, this is also a place for visitors to the temple to sit and rest. Here, there are no Arhat statues like other pagodas, which is also a difference from ancient Vietnamese pagodas in Bac Giang. It can be seen that Vinh Nghiem Pagoda has a strong Buddhist-Vietnamese cultural identity in that it has reserved two ancestral temples of the Truc Lam Yen Tu Zen sect without worshiping Bodhidharma. Or, according to the architectural layout of the pagoda, it can be understood that the ancient ancestors followed Buddhism but still valued Indian Buddhism and the Mahayana sect introduced into our country. That is shown in the Tien Duong - Three Jewels building built in the first house, facing the large space ahead. Thus, at Vinh Nghiem Pagoda, architectural styles of the 18th and 19th centuries exist side by side, which not only brings about the diversity of the project but also serves as a good example for comparative research on architectural periods. Vietnamese traditional. The system of Buddha statues at Vinh Nghiem pagoda is relatively complete in form, position, hierarchy, function,... and are all beautiful sculptures in the treasure trove of Buddha statues in Vietnam. Round statue sculpture at Vinh Nghiem Pagoda occupies a special position in terms of typical artistic value of the Nguyen Dynasty. The system of Buddha statues is very large in number, rich in shape, proportion, and diverse in expression. The sculptural art is standard in terms of proportions depicting the feet according to the conventional style of Buddha statues. The greatest architectural value of Vinh Nghiem Pagoda is in the spatial landscape with a beautiful feng shui location and in the seamless connection of construction items, creating a magnificent hundred-room pagoda-like floor plan. affirming its role as a Buddhist center belonging to the Truc Lam Yen Tu Zen sect.

Each wooden board used to carve sutras is on average 50cm long, 25cm wide and about 2.5cm thick. If you want to see all the ancient scriptures here, you must have a 250m² area of ​​land to spread out the scriptures. The sutra was carved on thi wood, a type of tree that grows commonly in this mountainous area. Thi wood is not only durable but also very light, this is also a convenient feature for carving and transporting sutras.

Therefore, when leveling fields, the Mong people use butterfly hoes to create soil banks, use their feet to step on them, and use the back of the hoe to pound hard to compact the banks. The water receiving points for the fields are taken from the creek sources above. If the low point is crossed, a large tree is used to split it in half and cut out the intestines to make a water trough. To create a contour line for each piece of field, the people use water to create a line to balance the waves. In low places, use a butterfly hoe to further level it; The high places are flattened to the banks, so the whole field around the hill has the same water and height, creating even steps throughout. Even in the way of dividing water, the Mong people only share water from the upper bank to the lower bank in a non-seamless way (the first plot shares the beginning of the bank, the lower plot must share in the middle of the bank, the next plot shares the water drain at the end of the bank). to minimize when floods create strong currents that break the banks and wash away all the color. In recent years, Mu Cang Chai Rice Terraces has become a tourist destination attracting many domestic and foreign tourists.
