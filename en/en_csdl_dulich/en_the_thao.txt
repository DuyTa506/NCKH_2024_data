Yes, even if I try, I won't be able to be as good as others, but I will definitely be better than myself in the present. You have to walk to find a way, you have to walk to know how many potholes there are and find a way to overcome them. IF YOU DON'T GO AND ARE AFRAID OF FALLING, IF YOU JUST LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE'S THREATS, YOU WILL NEVER REACH THE FINAL LINE OF CONFIDENCE.” These are the words found on the Facebook page of Gym Tuan Anh (Hau Giang).
