Not only does it change the lives of farmers here, the community-based tourism model in Giang Bien also contributes bright spots to sustainable agricultural and rural tourism in the Capital.
You know, Giang is a river, Bien is a border/boundary. Giang Bien is the name used to call the ancient land of Vu Dam, located on the right bank of the gentle Duong River, including two villages of Tinh Quang and Quan Tinh. Quan Tinh village also has the common name Ke Tanh, associated with the legend of Princess Ngoc Han (Princess of the Later Le Dynasty, later becoming Queen of the Tay Son Dynasty as the Queen of the Northern Palace - the second wife of Hoang Hoang). Emperor Quang Trung). That year, it rained so heavily that many places were flooded, even the capital Thang Long was flooded with meters of water. But when the princess passed by the village's shop to take shelter from the rain, the sky suddenly cleared and the rain stopped. So the name Ke Tanh was given to the village by Princess Ngoc Han... - While taking us to visit the family's clean vegetable garden, Ms. Nguyen Thi Nam passionately told about the history of Giang Bien.
Giving each person a small basket to collect tomatoes, Ms. Nam excitedly shared the secret to planting and caring for clean, ripe red tomatoes that can be eaten right in the garden. She also did not forget to remind us to hurry up so we could continue moving to Mr. Truong's house to learn the steps of making banh duc; Go to Ms. Nam's house to practice rope braiding, explore the traditional craft of making hammocks... That's how the kind and simple farmers here help us temporarily forget the pressures and worries of everyday life while experiencing VietHarvest AgriTour agricultural tourism model has just launched in Giang Bien.
Bright spot on green tourism
The model was developed from the Community Project "Improving the livelihoods of farmers in suburban areas of Hanoi - Agricultural tourism as a business industry supporting diverse sources of income" developed by Group Joint Stock Company Vietnamese community enterprise (VietED) implemented with funding from The Asia Foundation (TAF) and GSRD Foundation (GSRD Foundation).

Tinh Quang communal house-pagoda relic...
Mr. Nguyen Tri Thanh - expert on climate change and environment of the Asia Foundation said: Before designing the tours, project experts had many years of working with Giang Bien farmers, through Project "A better life for farmers and Food safety for consumers through the urban cooperative model" supported by TAF and GSRD Fund, implemented since 2019. "Going to phase Next, we want to further diversify people's livelihood sources through developing an agricultural tourism model to attract visitors from Hanoi and other provinces and cities. This is truly a challenge because Changing people's thinking from simply farming to providing services is not simple, requiring a process of perseverance and persistence. Funding from foundations cannot last forever. , so to ensure sustainability, we must build a suitable business model and help people operate that model smoothly and effectively" - Mr. Thanh emphasized.
After completing the tourism product design, the project's group of experts trained through simulation and practical experience, then transferred it so that farming households could deploy it; At the same time, connect with travel companies to bring products to tourists.
Sharing about the new knowledge she had just learned, Ms. Nguyen Thi Loan, representative of a farmer participating in the agricultural tourism model in Giang Bien, said she still remembers the free experience trips organized by the project. held positions at Chimi Farm, Detrang Farm (Hanoi), especially in Sa Pa (Lao Cai) to learn how to do agricultural tourism: "I have never been able to go that far. For a long time, I I only know how to hoe the fields and grow vegetables.

I feel like I have just taken another step forward. new development, very excited and hope that more and more tourists will come to Giang Bien."

Bring agricultural and rural tourism into a mainstream product line
Many other destinations in all regions of the country have been forming tourism products with agricultural and rural cultural characteristics, contributing to realizing Vietnam's tourism development strategy to 2030 with Oriented to strongly develop key and advantageous products of Vietnamese tourism, including agricultural and rural tourism.
There are many community tours that have built a brand, attracting domestic and foreign tourists, such as: tours to see terraced fields in the Northwest provinces; Visit Duong Lam ancient village (Hanoi) in ripe rice season; experience farming work in Hoi An (Quang Nam); agricultural tourism in Da Lat (Lam Dong); or garden tourism in the Mekong Delta... Not only does it bring more sustainable livelihoods to the community, it also helps preserve and promote ecological values, agricultural and rural culture, this type of tourism It also contributes to diversifying Vietnam's tourism map and improving the competitiveness of the smokeless industry.
However, agricultural and rural tourism in many parts of the country is still developing spontaneously, fragmented, lacking unique creativity, so it has not created added value and differentiation for products. Many destinations have difficulty connecting with relevant parties, such as investors, tourism experts, travel businesses... to perfect products that attract tourists.
One of the main reasons is due to limitations in people's awareness and tourism skills. According to Deputy Director of the Vietnam National Tourism Administration Ha Van Sieu, the residential community is a central object with a particularly important role, determining the success or failure of tourism development programs and projects. agricultural and rural tourism, but most are still confused in the process of absorbing, integrating, and converting to tourism services in their own homeland. Therefore, it is important that tourism management agencies and related parties provide support so that people can travel and carry out favorable tourism activities.
Ms. Truong Thi Bich Ngoc - consultant, design, training, and education expert of agricultural and rural tourism projects said: "Through the process of working with people, we have found a method is to visualize processes. For example, the issue of ensuring food hygiene and safety, operating tours or welcoming guests, instead of giving very long and difficult to remember rules, we try to concretize them into images and models that are easy for people to understand and implement. It is important to mobilize the participation of relevant parties with the same vision to ensure the best coordination and come up with a model. The model is easy to apply in practice, can operate for a long time, and is effective for people."
The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) predicts: Agricultural and rural tourism will become a strong growth segment in the coming time; By 2030, the number of tourists participating in this type globally will account for 10%, with a revenue of about 30 billion USD, an annual growth of 10-30%, while traditional types of tourism only have average growth. average 4%/year. Therefore, if you know how to take advantage of its inherent advantages, agricultural and rural tourism in Vietnam will certainly become a "gold mine" of the national green economy.
In August 2022, the Government approved the Rural Tourism Development Program in building new rural areas for the period 2021-2025, with the goal of promoting rural tourism associated with promoting agricultural potential and advantages. industries, cultural craft villages and ecological environment of localities, in order to improve the quality of material and spiritual life of rural people, contributing to restructuring the rural economy towards multi-value integration. governance, inclusiveness and sustainable development.
To achieve this goal, experts believe that it is necessary to include agricultural and rural tourism planning in the overall planning of the national tourism system based on a comprehensive assessment of the current status of agricultural tourism development. , rural areas in localities, recommend appropriate models and have synchronous support policies (such as: access to capital, technology, infrastructure investment, human resource training, communication support promote...) on a national scale. In addition, the connection between the subjects of agricultural and rural tourism activities with investors and travel companies needs to be promoted on the basis of harmonizing interests to create tours, routes, and tourism products.

Mr. Nguyen Tri Thanh - expert on climate change and environment of the Asia Foundation said: Before designing the tours, project experts had many years of working with Giang Bien farmers, through Project "A better life for farmers and Food safety for consumers through the urban cooperative model" supported by TAF and GSRD Fund, implemented since 2019. "Going to phase Next, we want to further diversify people's livelihood sources through developing an agricultural tourism model to attract visitors from Hanoi and other provinces and cities. This is truly a challenge because Changing people's thinking from simply farming to providing services is not simple, requiring a process of perseverance and persistence. Funding from foundations cannot last forever. , so to ensure sustainability, we must build a suitable business model and help people operate that model smoothly and effectively" - Mr. Thanh emphasized.

Bring agricultural and rural tourism into a mainstream product line
Many other destinations in all regions of the country have been forming tourism products with agricultural and rural cultural characteristics, contributing to realizing Vietnam's tourism development strategy to 2030 with Oriented to strongly develop key and advantageous products of Vietnamese tourism, including agricultural and rural tourism.
There are many community tours that have built a brand, attracting domestic and foreign tourists, such as: tours to see terraced fields in the Northwest provinces; Visit Duong Lam ancient village (Hanoi) in ripe rice season; experience farming work in Hoi An (Quang Nam); agricultural tourism in Da Lat (Lam Dong); or garden tourism in the Mekong Delta... Not only does it bring more sustainable livelihoods to the community, it also helps preserve and promote ecological values, agricultural and rural culture, this type of tourism It also contributes to diversifying Vietnam's tourism map and improving the competitiveness of the smokeless industry.
However, agricultural and rural tourism in many parts of the country is still developing spontaneously, fragmented, lacking unique creativity, so it has not created added value and differentiation for products. Many destinations have difficulty connecting with relevant parties, such as investors, tourism experts, travel businesses... to perfect products that attract tourists.
One of the main reasons is due to limitations in people's awareness and tourism skills. According to Deputy Director of the Vietnam National Tourism Administration Ha Van Sieu, the residential community is a central object with a particularly important role, determining the success or failure of tourism development programs and projects. agricultural and rural tourism, but most are still confused in the process of absorbing, integrating, and converting to tourism services in their own homeland. Therefore, it is important that tourism management agencies and related parties provide support so that people can travel and carry out favorable tourism activities.
Ms. Truong Thi Bich Ngoc - consultant, design, training, and education expert of agricultural and rural tourism projects said: "Through the process of working with people, we have found a method is to visualize processes. For example, the issue of ensuring food hygiene and safety, operating tours or welcoming guests, instead of giving very long and difficult to remember rules, we try to concretize them into images and models that are easy for people to understand and implement. It is important to mobilize the participation of relevant parties with the same vision to ensure the best coordination and come up with a model. The model is easy to apply in practice, can operate for a long time, and is effective for people."
The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) predicts: Agricultural and rural tourism will become a strong growth segment in the coming time; By 2030, the number of tourists participating in this type globally will account for 10%, with a revenue of about 30 billion USD, an annual growth of 10-30%, while traditional types of tourism only have average growth. average 4%/year. Therefore, if you know how to take advantage of its inherent advantages, agricultural and rural tourism in Vietnam will certainly become a "gold mine" of the national green economy.
In August 2022, the Government approved the Rural Tourism Development Program in building new rural areas for the period 2021-2025, with the goal of promoting rural tourism associated with promoting agricultural potential and advantages. industries, cultural craft villages and ecological environment of localities, in order to improve the quality of material and spiritual life of rural people, contributing to restructuring the rural economy towards multi-value integration. governance, inclusiveness and sustainable development.
To achieve this goal, experts believe that it is necessary to include agricultural and rural tourism planning in the overall planning of the national tourism system based on a comprehensive assessment of the current status of agricultural tourism development. , rural areas in localities, recommend appropriate models and have synchronous support policies (such as: access to capital, technology, infrastructure investment, human resource training, communication support promote...) on a national scale. In addition, the connection between the subjects of agricultural and rural tourism activities with investors and travel companies needs to be promoted on the basis of harmonizing interests to create tours, routes, and tourism products.

This context requires the ASEAN tourism industry to strengthen cooperation to enhance the region's competitiveness, in which developing festival tourism is considered one of the important directions to promote connectivity and diversity. internalization of intra-bloc tourism products.
Speaking at the ASEAN Festival Tourism Conference recently hosted by the Vietnam National Tourism Administration in Hanoi, Deputy Director Ha Van Sieu commented: One of the outstanding trends of global tourism in the future Translation is sustainable and responsible tourism. Tourism development not only contributes to socio-economic growth, benefits businesses and creates livelihoods for the community, but also contributes to preserving cultural values ​​and natural resources of the country. destination. With a diverse culture, both similar and unique among member countries, especially a rich and colorful system of traditional and contemporary festivals, the ASEAN region possesses a rich source of Abundant and valuable tourism resources that can be exploited into strong products, creating a difference for the destination's image. Vietnam is taking on the role of Chairman of the ASEAN Tourism Resources, Monitoring and Evaluation Committee and is the main coordinator of the project "Building ASEAN festival tourism products". Vietnam's tourism industry hopes to promote cooperation with ASEAN national tourism agencies to research and connect festival tours in the region to increase attraction of international visitors and promote ASEAN as a common destination that is sustainable, unified and worth experiencing.
In recent years, the type of tourism associated with festivals has gradually developed in many Southeast Asian countries. The way the festival is organized is increasingly innovated and professionalized with many activities to attract tourists. Many festivals have become national brands, attracting a large number of participants from all over the world, typically the water festival, the lantern releasing festival (Thailand), and the Chnam New Year festival. Thmei (Cambodia), boat racing festival (Laos), Bali art festival (Indonesia), MassKara smile festival (Philippines)...
Participating in these activities, visitors will not only be able to immerse themselves in the vibrant and jubilant atmosphere of the festival, but also explore and learn about the unique rituals, customs, and cultural identities of the region. indigenous community. Festival tourism has contributed to the overall growth in tourist arrivals to ASEAN countries, with the growth rate in 2019 reaching 6.1%, higher than the world's overall growth rate (4%) according to statistics from the World Health Organization. ASEAN Secretariat.
However, experts say that the development of ASEAN festival tourism is still not commensurate with its inherent potential, has not created a unique brand for the region, and compared to other tourism products in the region. competition is still limited.
Master Le Thi Minh Que, Travel Management Department, Vietnam National Tourism Administration commented: Festivals in the ASEAN region are very diverse but some places are still not really interested in promoting their values. the attractiveness of the festival to serve tourism. Festival tourism products in general lack uniqueness, many festivals are cumbersome and similar to each other. The work of advertising and promoting festival tourism also has many limitations; Cooperation between ASEAN countries in connecting and building festival tourism products is not specific, leading to the desired results not being achieved.
To change this situation, Master Le Thi Minh Que believes that, along with promoting fostering and training to support people in developing community tourism associated with festivals, ASEAN countries need to further strengthen Share experiences between countries in organizing, exploiting, and linking festivals with tourism effectively, especially in linking and surveying routes and destinations to build attractive festival tourism products for tourists. area. In addition, it is necessary to actively invest in creating content to promote festival tourism through digital technology platforms; and continue to have more favorable visa policies to not only attract the traditional source of tourists, the Northeast Asian market, but also target tourists from distant markets with high spending ability and long-term stays.
According to Dr. Le Tuan Anh, Head of the Department of Tourism Management and International Languages, Hanoi University of Culture, almost all destinations have festivals, but not all festivals can become reasons for tourists to visit the destination. Therefore, each country needs to select and identify one or several outstanding festivals that represent the image of the destination to promote as the basic theme and value that attracts tourists to Southeast Asia.
Sharing the same opinion, Director of the Institute of Tourism Development Research Nguyen Anh Tuan said that, given the situation that countries in the bloc are still developing festival tourism in a strong way, everyone does it individually but not together, it is necessary. is to have a strategy to jointly survey, research, build products, find outstanding folk and contemporary festivals, which can be connected to jointly promote and promote through media channels, especially digital communication.
Talking about the experience of organizing tourism associated with festivals in destinations, Mr. Nguyen Van Phuc, Director of the Department of Tourism of Thua Thien Hue province said: In recent years, festival events have been organized densely and widely. throughout the province, creating cultural weeks and months and festivals serving tourism throughout the year such as Hue Festival, Hue Traditional Craft Festival, Hue Ao Dai Week, Health Care Week..., contributing to increase the participation effect of tourists and the community, creating interesting products and destinations. To build Hue into a Festival city of Vietnam, Thua Thien Hue has implemented the Four Seasons Festival Project with a series of festival activities throughout the year, including a full range of traditional festivals from the royal court and folk. , religion, to contemporary art or sports, in order to honor and promote the unique cultural features of the land, exploit the strengths of scenic spots, spiritual tourism, and create favorable opportunities for the public and Tourists can participate at any time when coming to Hue.
Mr. Phuc emphasized that focusing on diversifying and improving the quality of unique and classy festival tourism products will create competitiveness in attracting visitors and destination revenue.
Mr. Try Chhiv, Director of the Department of International Cooperation and ASEAN, Ministry of Tourism of Cambodia, shared that his country also determined that festivals play an important role in preserving and promoting community cultural identity and developing tourism. calendar. That is why recently, besides traditional festivals, Cambodia has also created many modern festivals such as sea festivals, river festivals, and in the future there may be festivals associated with mountains, rice, elephants... things that have the potential to develop into festivals.
According to Mr. Try Chhiv, to tighten tourism cooperation among ASEAN countries, there needs to be a cooperation mechanism at a smaller level than the sub-region to connect policymakers and tourism businesses to exchange ideas and learn from each other. This will be a way to promote ASEAN tourism in general and festival tourism in particular.

The golden morning sunlight is like forest honey falling over the cabbage fields, bringing the gentleness of Autumn to the mountain tops of the Thai and Mong people since forever. The end of Autumn is more golden, the yellow is dyed with the color of countless mustard flowers, a familiar friend of mountain people for many generations.
Goose.
During this time, people from highland areas burn the fields after the ripe rice crop and scatter mustard seeds as vegetables to eat all year round. There's no need to fertilize too much, the salty taste of the rice straw ash fertilizes the mustard greens. Strong varieties of mustard greens continue to grow green and lush on the high green mountains.
That type of cabbage grows in no way. The mustard seeds that had been dormant from the previous season in the bamboo tube, soaked with kitchen smoke, were brought out to soak in the cool stream bed. The mustard seeds that had just awakened from their long awakening were brought up by the villagers and scattered evenly on the fields, which were still warm with ash.
Meeting the fertile mountainside soil and the gentle autumn rains, the mustard greens continued to grow, jostling each other in the fields. A healthy season of choysum in the West has begun like that.
In just a short time, mustard greens have sprouted all over the mountain tops, slopes, rock holes, and promontories. Vegetables that like mountain soil grow as high as a person's chest, each leafy green leaf is fat, the leaf edges are curled like a chicken's comb, and the stem is plump and succulent. At that time, the mustard greens were harvested, and the green mustard greens were packed together in bags and baskets and carried back to the village as vegetables to eat every day.
Every afternoon, the cabbage field shines a green color, illuminated by the shining sun. A few Mong girls carried baskets on their backs and worked to pluck cabbage. On the other side of the hill, Thai girls also stretched their arms in colorful dresses to pick vegetables and put them in heavy baskets on their backs.
Prepare for the new cabbage season.
On Autumn days, vegetables cannot be missing on the rattan tray. The mountain vegetables are so clean, so crispy and so delicious. The mustard greens are picked fresh and plump, cut off the old stems, boil until tender, then dip in ginger salt, it's delicious. Also a dish of Mong vegetables, a piece of pork dried on the kitchen floor last season, take it down and smash it a few times to remove the soot, soak it in boiling water for about half an hour, then slice it thinly and stir-fry it with green vegetables. So you get a specialty that can only be found in these remote villages.
Whether the preparation is simple or elaborate, the cook often twists to cut the vegetables into pieces instead of using a knife to chop them, thus ensuring that the natural sweet flavor of the vegetables is preserved. Many eateries and restaurants in the mountain town of Muong Xen (Ky Son) or Kim Son (Que Phong) also find ways to make kale into a specialty such as boiled kale dipped in soy sauce with boiled eggs, stir-fried kale, and kale. pickled cabbage...
When the vegetable season is about to end, Mong people pick it up and salt it to eat. Just need a few mountain ginger roots, sliced ​​galangal roots, and re-dried vegetables, but Mong mothers salt dozens of large bamboo stalks of sauerkraut to dry in the sun on the hillside. Just a few days later, the cabbage soaked in salt turned yellow, dark yellow, crispy, fragrant and spicy.
In some more remote villages, fresh food is rare, people choose sunny days to dry the mustard leaves carefully, storing them for the coming cold winter days.
This dried cabbage is often cooked with minced Mong chicken. Sitting next to the pink stove, outside with frost threatening to creep through the roof and po mu wooden walls, enjoying a pot of curried cabbage and chicken soup with upland rice is very heartwarming.
Happy with farming.
Sometimes at the end of the mustard season, people stop picking them because they have to save the flowers to bear fruit and make seeds for the next season. So, the mountains and hills, after many days wearing the rich green clothes of the fields, now wear the yellow color of new clothes.
A beautiful flower season in the mountains and forests, the mustard flower season, the yellow flower season that is more golden than honey, more than the early autumn sunshine. The day before, only a few tall, lanky mustard plants were flowering. A few days later, the whole mountainside was full of flowers, the yellow color spreading from the top of the mountain to the bottom of the mountain, from one mountain top to the other.
Hmong girl checks in with mustard flowers.
The mustard and yellow seasons come and go in the bright colors of Autumn, in the coolness of the weather blending with the colorfulness of Mong dresses on the cliffs. The mustard season is coming to a western region with deep green mountains and hills.

In addition, mobilizing community participation in tourism development is also a solution to help create more livelihoods, improve people's lives, and raise their awareness in preserving the living environment and tourism resources. history, cultural identity, and at the same time enriching products for Vietnam's tourism industry in a positive way.
Aware of the importance of community-based tourism development, in recent times, a number of localities and destinations in our country have applied many practical solutions to encourage the community to participate in tourism.
Deputy Director of the Department of Culture, Sports and Tourism of Son La province Tran Xuan Viet said: Since 2014, after the Prime Minister issued a decision approving the Master Plan for development of Moc Chau National Tourist Area By 2020, with a vision to 2030, the People's Council of Son La province for the first time issued many specific resolutions with policies to support community tourism development; Next are a series of guidelines and policies that create momentum for community tourism to develop breakthroughs, contributing to encouraging and encouraging ethnic communities to preserve and promote cultural values ​​as well as invest in development. local tourism.

The People's Committees of Moc Chau and Van Ho districts also regularly organize training classes. Improve vocational skills for tourism, guide the community on professional skills in promoting and marketing tourism products... Thanks to that, Moc Chau has emerged as a bright spot in community tourism.
In the case of Sa Pa (Lao Cai), to promote the development of community tourism, the town has prioritized budget sources for implementing projects to preserve and promote the cultural values ​​of ethnic minorities above. locality.
Master Hoang Thi Vuong, Head of the Culture and Information Department of Sa Pa town, said: For villages and hamlets that have the potential to develop into community tourism destinations, Sa Pa arranges resources to support people.

According to experts, people doing tourism business in many places are still spontaneous, lacking skills and experience in organization and operation, especially limited foreign language skills. Therefore, for community-based tourism to be successful, it is necessary to have investment policies for people, strategic solutions to train tourism professionals, and improve the skills and abilities of the community. in the scientific and flexible application of learned knowledge to welcome and serve tourists. In addition, tourism expert Dr. Nguyen Van Luu said that there needs to be socialization policies to motivate the community, such as: Coordinating research, surveys and financial investment and resources for tourism. restore and preserve community-owned tourism resources; have policies to coordinate exploitation and enjoy mutual benefits; Promotion policies, introducing resource values...
Experience in tourism development in many countries shows that the active participation of local people in tourism development is necessary, because the local community is the determining factor in the cultural environment, lifestyle, and lifestyle. Destination identity - important factors that attract tourists. Therefore, to develop community-based tourism, preserving and promoting indigenous values ​​is a decisive issue. This can only be done on the basis that people truly understand the value of the natural and human resources they hold, benefit from tourism exploitation associated with these values ​​and are conscious of preserving them. preserve and protect resources. Only then will community-based tourism development be truly sustainable.

A breakthrough with night tourism
It's easy to see that night tourism models at heritage and cultural sites that have been operating for a period of time have really blown a new breeze, receiving a strong response from tourists.
Among them are prominent names such as "Sacred Night" of Hoa Lo Prison Relics, which has become an anticipated event for many tourists, especially young people.
After the "fire" lit by Hoa Lo Prison Relics, the night tour "Decoding Thang Long Imperial Citadel" was born for visitors to experience going back in time and exploring the space of the ancient magnificent palace. .
This was followed by the launch of the tour "The Mind, the Talent" at the Vietnam Literature Museum. At the end of October, the Temple of Literature - Quoc Tu Giam night tour called "Essence of Taoism" was also launched in the excitement of the people of the Capital.
Or recently, at Quan Chuong Gate with the performance "Heritage Night" made Hanoi's hundred-year-old gateway seem to "come alive" telling ancient stories...

These include the National History Museum bicycle tour project that takes visitors to visit Thang Long Imperial Citadel and enjoy cuisine at Truc Bach walking street; or the night tour of the Cultural and Arts Center at 22 Hang Buom, taking participants to experience the cultural space at Hoan Kiem Lake walking street.
This makes domestic and foreign tourists coming to Hanoi have more diverse choices to experience a "new and ancient" Hanoi with emotional historical and cultural lessons.
Quan Chuong Gate with the performance "Heritage Night".
Among the activities mentioned above, many activities take place at night. This groundbreaking change of scenery brings uniqueness, attracting a large number of tourists, especially young people, to visit and explore.
These activities not only promote the development of the Capital's tourism industry but also increase the experience for tourists at an unprecedented angle, a step towards making Hanoi's nights "longer" and more interesting.
Through what the new tours in Hanoi bring, it cannot be denied that the night tour series has truly "awakened" the potential of the cultural and historical heritage chain in Hanoi. In fact, the programs have changed "spectacularly", reviving many historical values ​​in particular and helping tourism activities become more attractive from an overall perspective.
The numbers flourish and carry a lot of meaning
According to the Hanoi Department of Tourism, in 2023, Hanoi tourism will have a strong recovery, with impressive results, as expected in 2023, the total number of tourists coming to Hanoi will reach 24 million visitors, an increase of 27%. compared to 2022; including 4 million international visitors (with 2.82 million international visitors staying), an increase of 138.1% compared to 2022 and 20 million domestic visitors, an increase of 16% compared to 2022.

Hanoi Capital's tourism brand is constantly being strengthened and enhanced on the international tourism map, specifically: Hanoi is honored to be awarded the following awards by the World Travel Awards: Successful tourist destination. the world's leading city for short stays; Asia's Leading City Tourism Destination, Asia's Leading City Tourism Destination for Short Breaks and Asia's Leading City Tourism Authority, “Best Golf City Destination” award world in 2023".

The tourism gift product festival attracts about 20,000 visitors;... Hanoi Fall Festival has the participation of more than 60,000 participants.
Hanoi tourism has a total revenue from tourists estimated at 87.65 trillion VND, this number increases by 45.5% compared to 2022.
These brightly colored numbers not only represent recovery but also contain more important meanings for the Capital's tourism industry.
It can be mentioned that the quantity and quality of cultural products sold have increased, reflected in the number of tickets as well as increased prices. The age of people interested in and using cultural and tourism services has also expanded, especially to young audiences, not just limited to those who love history and traditional culture.
Turn history and culture into high-value products
Mr. Tran Trung Hieu, Deputy Director of Hanoi Department of Tourism, informed: "Currently, if we evaluate the ticket sales of these tours, it can be said to be overloaded. At some attractive tourist destinations, visitors may have to wait months to get a ticket."
Compared to previous times, Mr. Hieu said that after many years of keeping the old expression, many cultural activities, historical relics, especially those related to revolutionary relics, can be said to be... falls into a state of "falling asleep" when it attracts very few interested people, especially young people.
The type of cultural tourism and historical relics has not yet developed commensurate with its potential and has not attracted tourists. Most of the new cultural sites and historical relics are in the form of initial investment or potential, so tourism services and entertainment spots are few.
Mr. Tran Trung Hieu, Deputy Director of Hanoi Department of Tourism, shared with Nhan Dan Newspaper an overview of tourism activities in Hanoi city recently.
However, this story has also changed at the present time. With the new approach and expression, customers are really excited to hold a ticket to visit and explore these places. This represents initial success for the units. From here on, these facilities will continue to increase the experience to maintain interest from the community.
Besides, it is impossible not to mention the heritage of craft villages, with a large scale and richness, mainly in suburban areas, with innovation. Hanoi City will also aim to create a vertical tourist route from the center to the suburban districts, becoming a seamless product line.
Deputy Director of Hanoi Department of Tourism said that the unit highly appreciates the birth of unique products; Although the price is increased, it is reasonable so that visitors can feel it is worth paying. This helps increase spending when tourists come to the capital.
Choosing the right approach will help Hanoi tourism exploit many of its inherent potentials.
The Capital's tourism industry will also continue to shape its thinking towards considering historical and cultural values ​​as high-value products that can be "packaged", expressing their own identity and stories to bring products to market. products can be sold on the market at a reasonable price.
Regarding science and technology application activities, the 4.0 revolution, Mr. Tran Trung Hieu, Deputy Director of Hanoi Department of Tourism, shared: "Appreciate destinations that are proactive in organizing communication apparatus, Innovative media content creates appeal. Regularly apply media channels and live-streams to spread the word to both domestic and international tourists.
Preserve the identity but will refresh it to suit the market
In order for cultural sites, historical relics in particular and tourist attractions in general to create new attraction, Hanoi city has directed and oriented units, businesses, organizations and individuals in tourism activities. Review and improve the quality of tourism products and services, organize activities, events and build new products to suit the needs and tastes of tourists to be ready to serve.
In the coming time, Hanoi city will continue to improve knowledge and skills to serve tourists and deploy civilized tourism behavior for the local community.
At the same time, the city continues to direct and orient the People's Committees of districts, towns and cities, and guide the Management Boards of tourist attractions to improve the quality of destinations associated with heritage - relics and craft villages; Upgrading tourism infrastructure systems; Upgrading and supplementing services at tourist destinations associated with heritage - monuments and craft villages is also emphasized.
Local management levels will also support propaganda and promotion of tourism products, standardizing presentations suitable for attractions; promote and introduce tourism products, destinations associated with heritage - monuments, and craft villages in the media; Digitize destinations associated with heritage - monuments and craft villages in a general introduction system using 360, 3D, and FLYCAM photo interfaces.
Along with that, the Department of Tourism focuses on cultural tourist attractions and historical relics that need to build distinct tourism products and consider tourism development as the basis for preserving and promoting price advantages. Heritage values ​​are linked with resort tourism and community tourism for mutual development.
In particular, in order for the activities to be organized in the most professional way, the city also invited experts to survey and evaluate the current state of tourism infrastructure, materials and techniques, and the ability to exploit tourism values. Heritage - relics and craft villages serve to form ideas to build tourism products with characteristics of each locality. At the same time, create connections to form inter-regional tourist routes.
An issue of great concern is that establishments will be facilitated to have management and personnel mechanisms... suitable to the actual situation. Along with that, during the operation process, with tourist attractions being the city's public service units, there will be changes in organizational structure, such as switching to an autonomous funding mechanism. Let units be proactive in their professional activities.
