The Thai Nha ethnic group still retains many interesting traditional values. From costumes, farming methods to customs that have been preserved over decades. If you like to learn about those everyday beauties, Atayal Resort will be the ideal destination. Here, you can immerse yourself in a truly indigenous cultural space. Join Eva Air Dealer to learn more in the article below!

Where should you go when traveling to Taiwan in the summer?
Top 3 most famous Los Angeles amusement parks
1. Taiwan Atayal Resort and Thai Nha ethnic community
Taiwan Atayal Resort is a rather strange destination for most foreign tourists. This place integrates relaxation, enjoying natural wonders along with activities to learn about cultural experiences. The management introduces a total of 16 ethnic minorities in Taiwan. Among them, the Thai Nha (Atayal) community is the focus.
This is the passion of a son of the Thai Nha ethnic group - Mr. Kao Ai-De. With the goal of preserving, spreading and developing our national culture. Mr. Kao Ai-De founded this resort in Nam Dau district, Pho Ly commune. This is also the largest concentration of Thai Nha people, accounting for the majority of the total 81,000 people. Visitors coming to this place not only spend time relaxing and healing. But also to learn and experience interesting activities with people. So, hurry up and book your flight tickets to Taiwan today!
2. Interesting cultural values ​​of Thai Nha people
Learning about the Thai Nha people, you not only learn more about an ethnic group. But more than that, feel and experience the primitive indigenous lifestyle in Taiwan. Eva Air ticket office will take you through each of those values ​​right below.
Greeting style of Thai Nha people
As soon as you arrive at Atayal resort, you will be welcomed with standard Thai Nha etiquette. They transfer a small plate or pan, and arrange wooden sticks on top. After that, people lit a fire and began to perform the jumping over ritual. While jumping, someone used a rope of elephant grass to hit him. According to traditional beliefs, this helps ward off evil spirits and bad luck.
People's good luck ritual
Before participating in this ritual, you will be given traditional costumes. At first glance, many people easily mistake that outfit for some ethnic group in Vietnam. But if you look closely, you will see clear differences, from the head scarf to the colorful vertical stripes. After that, you are ready to participate in the people's good luck festival. Luck is brought by throwing the ball with long sticks and sharp spikes. There are four spheres that represent wealth, fame, love and health. And with each ball, you have 3 chances to hit the target.
The terrifying practice of headhunting is revived
Since ancient times, the Thai Nha people also had scary old customs. One of them is evidence of a person's maturity. Accordingly, a Thai Nha man must reach the age of hunting his enemy's head to be considered an adult. This bizarre practice has long been eliminated. But if you come to Atayal Resort, you can still see part of this tradition with stone shelves containing human skull models.
Other interesting customs of the Thai Nha ethnic group
In addition, this place also has countless extremely interesting cultural activities. Thai Nha people also like trap dancing like some Vietnamese ethnic groups. They also have the custom of carrying the bride on her wedding day or at archery, hunting and gathering festivals. Atayal Resort has staff who are local Thai Nha people to both guide and serve visitors with the most authentic experiences.
3. What else is interesting about Atayal Resort?
Learning and discovering Thai Nha ethnic culture is only part of the vacation journey here. Outside of busy hours, you can find any corner to relax. Or, you can challenge yourself with the experience of skywalking to see the endless mountains. Or explore the Atayal Royal Palace, camp, stroll the ecological garden and enjoy delicious BBQ areas. Besides, this place also has many specialty dishes such as bamboo-tube rice, Ma Cao sausage, Thich Thong sausage, Ban Da grilled meat, Quoc Tinh coffee chicken soup, Thu Thu rib soup...
4. How to get to Atayal resort village
Buying cheap Eva Air tickets to Taipei is the first step for you to get here. From Taipei, you can choose a taxi, train or bus to travel to Taichung city. However, consider carefully because transportation fees can be quite expensive. If you rent a private car, follow Quoc Tin intersection and Highway 6. Along this road there are quite a few other famous attractions such as Nhat Nguyet lagoon, Chun Dai Don pagoda, Foley winery, Thanh Khaing farm , etc.

This is the passion of a son of the Thai Nha ethnic group - Mr. Kao Ai-De. With the goal of preserving, spreading and developing our national culture. Mr. Kao Ai-De founded this resort in Nam Dau district, Pho Ly commune. This is also the largest concentration of Thai Nha people, accounting for the majority of the total 81,000 people.

Learning about the Thai Nha people, you not only learn more about an ethnic group. But more than that, feel and experience the primitive indigenous lifestyle in Taiwan. Eva Air ticket office will take you through each of those values ​​right below.
Greeting style of Thai Nha people
As soon as you arrive at Atayal resort, you will be welcomed with standard Thai Nha etiquette. They transfer a small plate or pan, and arrange wooden sticks on top. After that, people lit a fire and began to perform the jumping over ritual. While jumping, someone used a rope of elephant grass to hit him. According to traditional beliefs, this helps ward off evil spirits and bad luck.
People's good luck ritual
Before participating in this ritual, you will be given traditional costumes. At first glance, many people easily mistake that outfit for some ethnic group in Vietnam. But if you look closely, you will see clear differences, from the head scarf to the colorful vertical stripes. After that, you are ready to participate in the people's good luck festival. Luck is brought by throwing the ball with long sticks and sharp spikes. There are four spheres that represent wealth, fame, love and health. And with each ball, you have 3 chances to hit the target.
The terrifying practice of headhunting is revived
Since ancient times, the Thai Nha people also had scary old customs. One of them is evidence of a person's maturity. Accordingly, a Thai Nha man must reach the age of hunting his enemy's head to be considered an adult. This bizarre practice has long been eliminated. But if you come to Atayal Resort, you can still see part of this tradition with stone shelves containing human skull models.
Other interesting customs of the Thai Nha ethnic group
In addition, this place also has countless extremely interesting cultural activities. Thai Nha people also like trap dancing like some Vietnamese ethnic groups. They also have the custom of carrying the bride on her wedding day or at archery, hunting and gathering festivals. Atayal Resort has staff who are local Thai Nha people to both guide and serve visitors with the most authentic experiences.
